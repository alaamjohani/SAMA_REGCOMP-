Content: Key prudential metrics related to risk-based capital ratios, leverage ratio and liquidity standards. Banks are required to disclose each metric's value using the corresponding standard's specifications for the reporting period-end (designated by T in the template below) as well as the four previous quarter-end figures (T-1 to T-4). All metrics are intended to reflect actual bank values for (T), with the exception of \"fully loaded expected credit losses (ECL)\" metrics, the leverage ratio (excluding the impact of any applicable temporary exemption of central bank reserves) and metrics designated as \"pre-floor\" which may not reflect actual values. Frequency: Quarterly. Format: Fixed. If banks wish to add rows to provide additional regulatory or financial metrics, they must provide definitions for these metrics and a full explanation of how the metrics are calculated (including the scope of consolidation and the regulatory capital used if relevant). The additional metrics must not replace the metrics in this disclosure requirement. Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant change in each metric's value compared with previous quarters, including the key drivers of such changes (eg whether the changes are due to changes in the regulatory framework, group structure or business model).

Explanation should be specific and, where appropriate, might be supplemented with quantitative information. In particular, if the RWA for securitisation exposures in the banking book are a main driver of the difference, banks are expected to explain the extent to which they are using each of the three potential approaches (SEC-ERBA, SEC-SA and 1,250% risk weight) for calculating SA RWA for securitisation exposures. \n\na \n\nb \n\nc \n\nd \n\nRWA \n\nRWA for modelled approaches banks which have received SAMA approval to use internal model \n\nRWA for portfolios where standardised approaches are used \n\nTotal Actual RWA (a + b) (ie RWA which banks report as current requirements) \n\nRWA calculated using full standardised approach (ie RWA used in capital floor computation) \n\n1 \n\n2 3 \n\n4 \n\n5 6 7 8 \n\nCredit risk (excluding counterparty credit risk) Counterparty credit risk Credit valuation adjustment Securitisation exposures in the banking book Market risk Operational risk Residual RWA Total \n\nPillar 3 Disclosure Requirements Framework\n\nVersion Number\n\n\nIssue Date\n\n\nPage Number 20 of 168 \n\n\n\nDefinitions and instructions Rows: \n\nCredit risk (excluding counterparty credit risk, credit valuation adjustments and securitisation exposures in the banking book) (row 1): \n\nDefinition of standardised approach: The standardised approach for credit risk.

Composition of capital and TLAC: \n\n14.1 The disclosures described in this chapter cover the composition of regulatory capital, the main features of regulatory capital instruments and, for global systemically important banks, the composition of total loss-absorbing capacity and the creditor hierarchies of material subgroups and resolution entities. The disclosure requirements related to TLAC only, are not required to be completed by banks unless otherwise specified by SAMA. \n\n14.2 The disclosure requirements set out in this chapter are: \n\n14.2.1 Table CCA - Main features of regulatory capital instruments and of other \n\ntotal loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) - eligible instruments \n\n14.2.2 Template CC1 - Composition of regulatory capital \n\n14.2.3 Template CC2 - Reconciliation of regulatory capital to balance sheet \n\n14.2.4 Template TLAC1 - TLAC composition for global systemically important \n\nbanks (G-SIBs) (at resolution group level) \n\n14.2.5 Template TLAC2 - Material subgroup entity - creditor ranking at legal \n\nentity level \n\n14.2.6 Template TLAC3 - Resolution entity - creditor ranking at legal entity level \n\n14.3 The following table and templates must be completed by all banks: \n\n14.3.1 Table CCA details the main features of a bank's regulatory capital instruments and other TLAC-eligible instruments, where applicable. This \n\ntable should be posted on a bank's website, with the web link referenced in \n\nthe bank's Pillar 3 report to facilitate users' access to the required disclosure. Table CCA represents the minimum level of disclosure that banks are required to report in respect of each regulatory capital instrument and, where applicable, other TLAC-eligible instruments issued.2 \n\n2 In this context, \"other TLAC-eligible instruments\" are instruments other than regulatory capital instruments issued by G-SIBs that meet the TLAC eligibility criteria. \n\nPillar 3 Disclosure Requirements Framework\n\nVersion Number\n\n\nIssue Date\n\n\nPage Number 25 of 168 \n\n\n\n14.3.2 Template CC1 details the composition of a bank's regulatory capital. \n\n14.3.3 Template CC2 provides users of Pillar 3 data with a reconciliation between \n\nthe scope of a bank's accounting consolidation, as per published financial statements, and the scope of its regulatory consolidation. \n\n14.4 The following additional templates must be completed by banks which have been \n\ndesignated as G-SIBs: \n\n14.4.1 Template TLAC1 provides details of the TLAC positions of G-SIB resolution groups. This disclosure requirement applies to all G-SIBs at the resolution group level. For single point of entry G-SIBs, there is only one resolution group. This means that they only need to complete Template TLAC1 once to report their TLAC positions. \n\n14.4.2 Templates TLAC2 and TLAC3 present information on creditor rankings at the legal entity level for material subgroup entities (ie entities that are part of a material subgroup) which have issued internal TLAC to one or more resolution entities, and also for resolution entities. These templates provide information on the amount and residual maturity of TLAC and on the instruments issued by resolution entities and material subgroup entities that rank pari passu with, or junior to, TLAC instruments. \n\n14.5 Templates TLAC1, TLAC2 and TLAC3 become effective from the TLAC \n\nconformance date. \n\n14.6 Through the following three-step approach, all banks are required to show the link between the balance sheet in their published financial statements and the numbers disclosed in Template CC1: \n\n14.6.1 Step 1: Disclose the reported balance sheet under the regulatory scope of consolidation in Template CC2. If the scopes of regulatory consolidation and accounting consolidation are identical for a particular banking group, banks should state in Template CC2 that there is no difference and move on to Step 2. Where the accounting and regulatory scopes of consolidation differ, banks are required to disclose the list of those legal entities that are included within the accounting scope of consolidation, but excluded from the regulatory scope of consolidation or, alternatively, any legal entities included in the regulatory consolidation that are not included in the accounting scope of consolidation. This will enable users of Pillar 3 data to consider any risks posed by unconsolidated subsidiaries. If some entities are included in both the regulatory and accounting scopes of consolidation, but the method of consolidation differs between these two scopes, banks are required to list the relevant legal entities separately and explain the \n\nPillar 3 Disclosure Requirements Framework\n\nVersion Number\n\n\nIssue Date\n\n\nPage Number 26 of 168 \n\n\n\ndifferences in the consolidation methods. For each legal entity that is required to be disclosed in this requirement, a bank must also disclose the \n\ntotal assets and equity on the entity's balance sheet and a description of the \n\nentity's principal activities. \n\n14.6.2 Step 2: Expand the lines of the balance sheet under the regulatory scope of consolidation in Template CC2 to display all of the components that are used in Template CC1. It should be noted that banks will only need to expand elements of the balance sheet to the extent necessary to determine the components that are used in Template CC1 (eg if all of the paid-in capital of the bank meets the requirements to be included in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, the bank would not need to expand this line). The level of \n\ndisclosure should be proportionate to the complexity of the bank's balance sheet and its capital structure. \n\n14.6.3 Step 3: Map each of the components that are disclosed in Template CC2 in \n\nStep 2 to the composition of capital disclosure set out in Template CC1. \n\nPillar 3 Disclosure Requirements Framework\n\nVersion Number\n\n\nIssue Date\n\n\nPage Number 27 of 168 \n\n\n\nTable CCA - Main features of regulatory capital instruments and of other TLAC-eligible instruments Purpose: Provide a description of the main features of a bank's regulatory capital instruments and other TLAC-eligible instruments, as applicable, that are recognised as part of its capital base / TLAC resources. Scope of application: The template is mandatory for all banks. In addition to completing the template for all regulatory capital instruments, G-SIB resolution entities should complete the template (including lines 3a and 34a) for all other TLAC-eligible instruments that are recognised as external TLAC resources by the resolution entities, starting from the TLAC conformance date. Internal TLAC instruments and other senior debt instruments are not covered in this template. Content: Quantitative and qualitative information as required. Frequency: Table CCA should be posted on a bank's website. It should be updated whenever the bank issues or repays a capital instrument (or other TLAC-eligible instrument where applicable), and whenever there is a redemption, conversion/writedown or other material change in the nature of an existing instrument. Updates should, at a minimum, be made semiannually. Banks should include the web link in each Pillar 3 report to the issuances made over the previous period. Format: Flexible.

Banks are required to report each instrument, including common shares, in a separate column of the template, such that the completed Table CCA would provide a \"main features report\" that summarises all of the regulatory capital and TLAC-eligible instruments of the banking group. G-SIBs disclosing these instruments should group them under three sections (horizontally along the table) to indicate whether they are for meeting (i) only capital (but not TLAC) requirements; (ii) both capital and TLAC requirements; or (iii) only TLAC (but not capital) requirements. \n\nRow number 1 2 3 3a \n\n4 \n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 9 10 \n\n11 12 13 \n\n14 15 \n\n16 17 \n\n18 \n\nExplanation \n\nIdentifies issuer legal entity. Unique identifier (eg CUSIP, ISIN or Bloomberg identifier for private placement). Specifies the governing law(s) of the instrument. Other TLAC-eligible instruments governed by foreign law (ie a law other than that of the home jurisdiction of a resolution entity) include a clause in the contractual provisions whereby investors expressly submit to, and provide consent to the application of, the use of resolution tools in relation to the instrument by the home authority notwithstanding any provision of foreign law to the contrary, unless there is equivalent binding statutory provision for cross-border recognition of resolution actions. Select \"NA\" where the governing law of the instrument is the same as that of the country of incorporation of the resolution entity. Specifies the regulatory capital treatment during the Basel III transitional phase (ie the component of capital from which the instrument is being phased out). Specifies regulatory capital treatment under Basel III rules not taking into account transitional treatment. Specifies the level(s) within the group at which the instrument is included in capital. \n\nSpecifies instrument type, varying by jurisdiction. Helps provide more granular understanding of features, particularly during transition. Specifies amount recognised in regulatory capital. Par value of instrument. Specifies accounting classification. Helps to assess loss-absorbency. \n\nSpecifies date of issuance. Specifies whether dated or perpetual. For dated instrument, specifies original maturity date (day, month and year). For perpetual instrument, enter \"no maturity\". Specifies whether there is an issuer call option. For instrument with issuer call option, specifies: (i) the first date of call if the instrument has a call option on a specific date (day, month and year); (ii) the instrument has a tax and/or regulatory event call; and (iii) the redemption price. Specifies the existence and frequency of subsequent call dates, if applicable. Specifies whether the coupon/dividend is fixed over the life of the instrument, floating over the life of the instrument, currently fixed but will move to a floating rate in the future, or currently floating but will move to a fixed rate in the future.

Specifies whether the issuer has full, partial or no discretion over whether a coupon/dividend is paid. If the bank has full discretion to cancel coupon/dividend payments under all circumstances, it must select \"fully discretionary\" (including when there is a dividend-stopper that does not have the effect of preventing the bank from cancelling payments on the instrument). If there are conditions that must be met before payment can be cancelled (eg capital below a certain threshold), the bank must select \"partially discretionary\". If the bank is unable to cancel the payment outside of insolvency, the bank must select \"mandatory\". Specifies whether there is a step-up or other incentive to redeem. Specifies whether dividends/coupons are cumulative or non-cumulative. \n\nSpecifies whether the instrument is convertible. \n\nSpecifies the conditions under which the instrument will convert, including point of non-viability. Where one or more authorities have the ability to trigger conversion, the authorities should be listed. For each of the authorities it should be stated whether the legal basis for the authority to trigger conversion is provided by the terms of the contract of the instrument (a contractual approach) or statutory means (a statutory approach). For conversion trigger separately, specifies whether the instrument will: (i) always convert fully; (ii) may convert fully or partially; or (iii) will always convert partially. Specifies the rate of conversion into the more loss-absorbent instrument. For convertible instruments, specifies whether conversion is mandatory or optional. For convertible instruments, specifies the instrument type it is convertible into. \n\nIf convertible, specifies the issuer of the instrument into which it converts. Specifies whether there is a writedown feature. Specifies the trigger at which writedown occurs, including point of non-viability. Where one or more authorities have the ability to trigger writedown, the authorities should be listed. For each of the authorities it should be stated whether the legal basis for the authority to trigger conversion is provided by the terms of the contract of the instrument (a contractual approach) or statutory means (a statutory approach). For each writedown trigger separately, specifies whether the instrument will: (i) always be written down fully; (ii) may be written down partially; or (iii) will always be written down partially. For writedown instruments, specifies whether writedown is permanent or temporary. \n\nFor instruments that have a temporary writedown, description of writeup mechanism. Type of subordination. \n\nSpecifies instrument to which it is most immediately subordinate. Where applicable, banks should specify the column numbers of the instruments in the completed main features template to which the instrument is most immediately subordinate. In the case of structural subordination, \"NA\" should be entered. Specifies whether there are non-compliant features.

(ii) The reconciliation requirements included in Template CC2 result in the decomposition of certain regulatory adjustments. For example, the disclosure template below includes the adjustment \"Goodwill net of related tax liability\". The reconciliation requirements will lead to the disclosure of both the goodwill component and the related tax liability component of this regulatory adjustment. \n\n(iii) Shading: \n\n- Each dark grey row introduces a new section detailing a certain component of regulatory capital. - Light grey rows with no thick border represent the sum cells in the relevant section. - Light grey rows with a thick border show the main components of regulatory capital and the capital adequacy ratios. \n\nColumns Source: Banks are required to complete column b to show the source of every major input, which is to be cross-referenced to the corresponding rows in Template CC2. Rows Set out in the following table is an explanation of each row of the template above. Regarding the regulatory adjustments, banks are required to report deductions from capital as positive numbers and additions to capital as negative numbers. For example, goodwill (row 8) should be reported as a positive number, as should gains due to the change in the own credit risk of the bank (row 14). However, losses due to the change in the own credit risk of the bank should be reported as a negative number as these are added back in the calculation of CET1 capital. Row number \n\nExplanation \n\nInstruments issued by the parent company of the reporting group that meet all of the CET1 capital entry criteria set out in SACAP2.2.1. This should be equal to the sum of common stock (and related surplus only) and other instruments for non-joint stock companies, both of which must meet the common stock criteria. This should be net of treasury stock and other investments in own shares to the extent that these are already derecognised on the balance sheet under the relevant accounting standards. Other paid-in capital elements must be excluded. All minority interest must be excluded. Retained earnings, prior to all regulatory adjustments. In accordance with SACAP2.2.1, this row should include interim profit and loss that has met any audit, verification or review procedures that SAMA has put in place. Dividends are to be removed in accordance with the applicable accounting standards, ie they should be removed from this row when they are removed from the balance sheet of the bank. Accumulated other comprehensive income and other disclosed reserves, prior to all regulatory adjustments. Directly issued capital instruments subject to phase-out from CET1 capital in accordance with the requirements of SACAP5.7. This is only applicable to non-joint stock companies. Banks structured as joint stock companies must report zero in this row. Common share capital issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties. Only the amount that is eligible for inclusion in group CET1 capital should be reported here, as determined by the application of SACAP3.1 (see SACAP Annex #7 for an example of the calculation).

The amount to be deducted will be the amount of other TLAC liabilities designated to the 5% threshold but not sold within 30 business days, no longer held in the trading book or now exceeding the 5% threshold (eg in the instance of decreasing CET1 capital). Note that, for G-SIBs, amounts designated to this threshold may not subsequently be moved to the 10% threshold.

For example, suppose a bank has 100 RWA, 10 CET1 capital, 1.5 additional Tier 1 capital and no Tier 2 capital. Since it does not have any Tier 2 capital, it will have to earmark its CET1 capital to meet the 8% minimum capital requirement. The net CET1 capital left to meet other requirements (which could include Pillar 2, buffers or TLAC requirements) will be 10 - 4.5 - 2 = 3.5.

For MPE G-SIBs, information is provided for each resolution group. Aggregation of capital and total RWA for capital purposes across resolution groups will not necessarily equal or directly correspond to values reported for regulatory capital and RWA under Template CC1. The TLAC position related to the regulatory capital of the resolution group shall include only capital instruments issued by entities belonging to the resolution group. Similarly, the TLAC position is based on the RWA (adjusted as permitted under Section 3 of the TLAC Term Sheet) and leverage ratio exposure measures calculated at the level of the resolution group. Regarding the shading: - Each dark grey row introduces a new section detailing a certain component of TLAC. - The light grey rows with no thick border represent the sum cells in the relevant section. - The light grey rows with a thick border show the main components of TLAC. \n\nThe following table explains each row of the above template. Regarding the regulatory adjustments, banks are required to report deductions from capital or TLAC as positive numbers and additions to capital or TLAC as negative numbers. For example, the amortised portion of Tier 2 where remaining maturity is greater than one year (row 7) should be reported as a negative number (as it adds back in the calculation of Tier 2 instruments eligible as TLAC), while Tier 2 capital ineligible as TLAC (row 8) should be reported as a positive number.

This row recognises that as long as the remaining maturity of a Tier 2 instrument is above the one-year residual maturity requirement of the TLAC Term Sheet, the full amount may be included in TLAC, even if the instrument is partially derecognised in regulatory capital via the requirement to amortise the instrument in the five years before maturity. Only the amount not recognised in regulatory capital but meeting all TLAC eligibility criteria should be reported in this row. Tier 2 instruments issued out of subsidiaries to third parties that are ineligible as TLAC. According to Section 8c of the TLAC Term Sheet, such instruments could be recognised to meet minimum TLAC until 31 December 2021.

The amount reported in this row must meet the subordination requirements set out in points (a) to (c) of Section 11 of the TLAC Term Sheet, or be exempt from the requirement by meeting the conditions set out in points (i) to (iv) of the same section. External TLAC instruments issued directly by the resolution entity that are not subordinated to Excluded Liabilities but meet the other TLAC Term Sheet requirements. The amount reported in this row should be those subject to recognition as a result of the application of the penultimate and antepenultimate paragraphs of Section 11 of the TLAC Term Sheet. The full amounts should be reported in this row, ie without applying the 2.5% and 3.5% caps set out the penultimate paragraph. The amount reported in row 13 above after the application of the 2.5% and 3.5% caps set out in the penultimate paragraph of Section 11 of the TLAC Term Sheet. External TLAC instrument issued by a funding vehicle prior to 1 January 2022. Amounts issued after 1 January 2022 are not eligible as TLAC and should not be reported here. Eligible ex ante commitments to recapitalise a G-SIB in resolution, subject to the conditions set out in the second paragraph of Section 7 of the TLAC Term Sheet. Non-regulatory capital elements of TLAC before adjustments. To be calculated as: row 12 + row 14 + row 15 + row 16. TLAC before adjustments. To be calculated as: row 11 + row 17. Deductions of exposures between MPE G-SIB resolution groups that correspond to items eligible for TLAC (not applicable for SPE G-SIBs). All amounts reported in this row should correspond to deductions applied after the appropriate adjustments agreed by the crisis management group (CMG) (following the penultimate paragraph of Section 3 of the TLAC Term Sheet, the CMG shall discuss and, where appropriate and consistent with the resolution strategy, agree on the allocation of the deduction). Deductions of investments in own other TLAC liabilities; amount to be deducted from TLAC resources in accordance with SACAP4.1.6. Other adjustments to TLAC. TLAC of the resolution group (as the case may be) after deductions. To be calculated as: row 18 - row 19 - row 20 - row 21. Total RWA of the resolution group under the TLAC regime. For SPE G-SIBs, this information is based on the consolidated figure, so the amount reported in this row will coincide with that in row 60 of Template CC1. Leverage exposure measure of the resolution group (denominator of leverage ratio). TLAC ratio (as a percentage of RWA for TLAC purposes), to be calculated as row 22 divided by row 23. TLAC ratio (as a percentage of leverage exposure measure), to be calculated as row 22 divided by row 24. CET1 capital (as a percentage of RWA) available after meeting the resolution group's minimum capital requirements and TLAC requirement. To be calculated as the CET1 capital adequacy ratio, less any common equity (as a percentage of RWA) used to meet CET1, Tier 1, and Total minimum capital and TLAC requirements. For example, suppose a resolution group (that is subject to regulatory capital requirements) has 100 RWA, 10 CET1 capital, 1.5 AT1 capital, no Tier 2 capital and 9 non-regulatory capital TLAC-eligible instruments. The resolution group will have to earmark its CET1 capital to meet the 8% minimum capital requirement and 18% minimum TLAC requirement. The net CET1 capital left to meet other requirements (which could include Pillar 2 or buffers) will be 10 - 4.5 - 2 - 1 = 2.5. Bank-specific buffer requirement (capital conservation buffer plus countercyclical buffer requirements plus G-SIB buffer requirement, expressed as a percentage of RWA). Calculated as the sum of: (i) the G-SIB's capital conservation buffer; (ii) the G-SIB's specific countercyclical buffer requirement calculated in accordance with SACAP; and (iii) the higher loss-absorbency requirement as set out in SACAP. Not applicable to individual resolution groups of an MPE G-SIB, unless the relevant authority imposes buffer requirements at the level of consolidation and requires such disclosure. The amount in row 28 (expressed as a percentage of RWA) that relates to the capital conservation buffer), ie G-SIBs will report 2.5% here. Not applicable to individual resolution groups of an MPE G-SIB, unless otherwise required by the relevant authority.

These liabilities are not included in column (g) in Template LI1. Assets that are risk-weighted under the Basel framework include assets that are not deducted from capital because they are under the applicable thresholds or due to the netting with liabilities. \n\nOff-balance sheet amounts include off-balance sheet original exposure in column (a) and the amounts subject to regulatory framework, after application of the credit conversion factors (CCFs) where relevant in columns (b)-(d). \n\nColumn (a) is not necessarily equal to the sum of columns (b)-(e) due to assets being risk-weighted more than once (see Template LI1). In addition, exposure values used for risk weighting may differ under each risk framework depending on whether standardized approaches or internal models are used in the computation of this exposure value. Therefore, for any type of risk framework, the exposure values under different regulatory approaches can be presented separately in each of the columns if a separate presentation eases the reconciliation of the exposure values for banks. \n\nThe breakdown of columns in regulatory risk categories (b)-(e) corresponds to the breakdown prescribed in the rest of the document, ie column (b) credit risk corresponds to the exposures reported in section 19, column (c) corresponds to the exposures reported in section 21, column (d) corresponds to exposures reported in section 20, and column (e) corresponds to the exposures reported in section 22. \n\nDifferences due to consideration of provisions: The exposure values under row 1 are the carrying amounts and hence net of provisions (ie specific and general provisions, as set out in SACAP2.2.3). Nevertheless, exposures under the foundation internal ratings-based (F-IRB) and advanced internal ratings-based (A-IRB) approaches are risk-weighted gross of provisions. Row 7 therefore is the re-inclusion of general and specific provisions in the carrying amount of exposures in the F-IRB and A-IRB approaches so that the carrying amount of those exposures is reconciled with their regulatory exposure value. Row 7 may also include the elements qualifying as general provisions that may have been deducted from the carrying amount of \n\nPillar 3 Disclosure Requirements Framework\n\nVersion Number\n\n\nIssue Date\n\n\nPage Number 50 of 168 \n\n\n\nexposures under the standardized approach and that therefore need to be reintegrated in the regulatory exposure value of those exposures. Any differences between the accounting impairment and the regulatory provisions under the Basel framework that have an impact on the exposure amounts considered for regulatory purposes should also be included in row 7. \n\nExposure amounts considered for regulatory purposes: The expression designates the aggregate amount considered as a starting point of the RWA calculation for each of the risk categories. Under the credit risk framework this should correspond either to the exposure amount applied in the standardized approach for credit risk (see SCRE5) or to the exposures at default (EAD) in the IRB approach for credit risk (see SCRE12.29); securitization exposures should be defined as in the securitization framework (see SCRE18.4 and SCRE18.5); and counterparty credit exposures are defined as the EAD considered for counterparty credit risk purposes (see SCCR5). \n\nLinkages across templates \n\nTemplate LI2 is focused on assets in the regulatory scope of consolidation that are subject to the regulatory framework.

On-balance sheet items include loans and debt securities. Off-balance sheet items must be measured according to the following criteria: (a) guarantees given - the maximum amount that the bank would have to pay if the guarantee were called. The amount must be gross of any credit conversion factor (CCF) or credit risk mitigation (CRM) techniques. (b) Irrevocable loan commitments - total amount that the bank has committed to lend.

The gross value is the accounting value before any allowance/impairments but after considering write-offs.

For example, when the accounting framework is IFRS 9, \"impaired exposures\" are those that are considered \"credit-impaired\" in the meaning of IFRS 9 Appendix A. When the accounting framework is US GAAP, \"impaired exposures\" are those exposures for which credit losses are measured under ASC Topic 326 and for which the bank has recorded a partial write-off/write-down. \n\nBanks must fill in column d to f in accordance with the categorization of accounting provisions distinguishing those meeting the conditions to be categorized in general provisions, as defined in SACAP2.2.3, and those that are categorized as specific provisions.

A bank would generally be considered a \"sponsor\" if it, in fact or in substance, manages or advises the programme, places securities into the market, or provides liquidity and/or credit enhancements. The programme may include, for example, ABCP conduit programmes and structured investment vehicles. \n\n affiliated entities (i) that the bank manages or advises and (ii) that invest either in the securitisation exposures that the bank has \n\nsecuritised or in SPEs that the bank sponsors. \n\n a list of entities to which the bank provides implicit support and the associated capital impact for each of them (as required in \n\nSCRE18.14 and SCRE18.49. \n\nSummary of the bank's accounting policies for securitisation activities. Where relevant, banks are expected to distinguish securitisation exposures from re-securitisation exposures. \n\nIf applicable, the names of external credit assessment institution (ECAIs) used for securitisations and the types of securitisation exposure for which each agency is used. If applicable, describe the process for implementing the Basel internal assessment approach (IAA). The description should include: \n\n structure of the internal assessment process and relation between internal assessment and external ratings, including information on \n\nECAIs as referenced in item (d) of this table. \n\n control mechanisms for the internal assessment process including discussion of independence, accountability, and internal \n\n \n\nassessment process review. the exposure type to which the internal assessment process is applied; and stress factors used for determining credit enhancement levels, by exposure type. For example, credit cards, home equity, auto, and securitisation exposures detailed by underlying exposure type and security type (eg residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, collateralised debt obligations) etc. \n\n(f) \n\nBanks must describe the use of internal assessment other than for SEC-IAA capital purposes. \n\nPillar 3 Disclosure Requirements Framework\n\nVersion Number\n\n\nIssue Date\n\n\nPage Number 97 of 168 \n\n\n\n"}

Derivatives and SFTs collateral refer to either collateral received or collateral provided (or any associated receivable asset) accounted as a balance sheet asset. Amounts are to be reported in accordance with SLEV7.1.1 to SLEV7.1.4 and, where applicable, SLEV6.4 and SLEV6.6. Grossed-up amount of any collateral provided in relation to derivative exposures where the provision of that collateral has reduced the value of the balance sheet assets under the bank's operative accounting framework, in accordance with SLEV7.2.3(ii). Deductions of receivable assets in the amount of the cash variation margin provided in derivatives transactions where the posting of cash variation margin has resulted in the recognition of a receivable asset under the bank's operative accounting framework. As the adjustments in this row reduce the exposure measure, they shall be reported as negative figures. Adjustment for securities received under a securities financing transaction where the bank has recognised the securities as an asset on its balance sheet. These amounts are to be excluded from the exposure measure in accordance with SLEV7.3.3(i). \n\nAs the adjustments in this row reduce the exposure measure, they shall be reported as negative figures. \n\nPillar 3 Disclosure Requirements Framework\n\nVersion Number\n\n\nIssue Date\n\n\nPage Number 139 of 168 \n\n\n\n5 \n\n6 \n\n7 \n\n8 \n\n9 \n\n10 \n\n11 \n\n12 \n\n13 \n\n14 \n\n15 \n\n16 \n\n17 \n\n18 \n\n19 \n\n20 \n\n21 \n\n22 \n\n23 \n\n24 25 \n\n25a \n\n26 27 28 \n\n29 \n\n30 \n\nAmounts of general and specific provisions that are deducted from Tier 1 capital which may be deducted from the exposure measure in accordance with SLEV7.1.2. \n\nAs the adjustments in this row reduce the exposure measure, they shall be reported as negative figures.

Sum of rows 1 to 6. Replacement cost (RC) associated with all derivatives transactions (including exposures resulting from direct transactions between a client and a CCP where the bank guarantees the performance of its clients' derivative trade exposures to the CCP). Where applicable, this amount should be net of cash variation margin received (as set out in SLEV7.2.4(ii), and with bilateral netting (as set out in SLEV7.2.2(vi) to (vii). This amount should be reported with the 1.4 alpha factor applied as specified in SLEV7.2.2 (ii) and (v) Add-on amount for the potential future exposure (PFE) of all derivative exposures calculated in accordance with SLEV7.2.2 (ii) and (v). This amount should be reported with the 1.4 alpha factor applied as specified in SLEV7.2.2 (ii) and (v). Trade exposures associated with the CCP leg of derivatives transactions resulting from client-cleared transactions or which the clearing member, based on the contractual arrangements with the client, is not obligated to reimburse the client in respect of any losses suffered due to changes in the value of its transactions in the event that a qualifying central counterparty (QCCP) defaults. As the adjustments in this row reduce the exposure measure, they shall be reported as negative figures. The effective notional amount of written credit derivatives which may be reduced by the total amount of negative changes in fair value amounts that have been incorporated into the calculation of Tier 1 capital with respect to written credit derivatives according to SLEV7.2.9. This row comprises: \n\n \n\n \n\nThe amount by which the notional amount of a written credit derivative is reduced by a purchased credit derivative on the same reference name according to SLEV7.2.9.

Sum of rows 8 to 12. The gross amount of SFT assets without recognition of netting, other than novation with QCCPs, determined in accordance with SLEV7.3.3, adjusted for any sales accounting transactions in accordance with SLEV7.3.4. The cash payables and cash receivables of gross SFT assets with netting determined in accordance with SLEV7.3.3(i)(b). As these adjustments reduce the exposure measure, they shall be reported as negative figures. The amount of the counterparty credit risk add-on for SFTs determined in accordance with SLEV7.3.3(ii). The amount for which the bank acting as an agent in a SFT has provided an indemnity or guarantee determined in accordance with SLEV7.3.5. Sum of rows 14 to 17. Total off-balance sheet exposure amounts (excluding off-balance sheet exposure amounts associated with SFT and derivative transactions) on a gross notional basis, before any adjustment for credit conversion factors (CCFs). Reduction in gross amount of off-balance sheet exposures due to the application of CCFs as specified in SLEV7.4.3(iv) to (x). As these adjustments reduce the exposure measure, they shall be reported as negative figures.

The amount of Tier 1 capital of the risk-based capital framework as defined in the definition of capital standard (SACAP) taking account of the transitional arrangements. Sum of rows 7, 13, 18 and 22. The leverage ratio is defined as the Tier 1 capital measure divided by the exposure measure, with this ratio expressed as a percentage. If a bank's leverage ratio exposure measure is subject to a temporary exemption of central bank reserves, this ratio is defined as the Tier 1 capital measure divided by the sum of the exposure measure and the amount of the central bank reserves exemption, with this ratio expressed as a percentage. If the bank's leverage ratio exposure measure is not subject to a temporary exemption of central bank reserves, this ratio will be identical to the ratio reported in row 25.

The averages are calculated after the application of any haircuts, inflow and outflow rates and caps, where applicable. For example: \n\nwhere T equals the number of observations in period Qi. Weighted figures of HQLA (row 1, third column) must be calculated after the application of the respective haircuts but before the application of any caps on Level 2B and Level 2 assets. Unweighted inflows and outflows (rows 2-8, 11-15 and 17-20, second column) must be calculated as outstanding balances. Weighted inflows and outflows (rows 2-20, third column) must be calculated after the application of the inflow and outflow rates. Adjusted figures of HQLA (row 21, third column) must be calculated after the application of both (i) haircuts and (ii) any applicable caps (ie cap on Level 2B and Level 2 assets). Adjusted figures of net cash outflows (row 22, third column) must be calculated after the application of both (i) inflow and outflow rates and (ii) any applicable cap (ie cap on inflows). The LCR (row 23) must be calculated as the average of observations of the LCR: \n\nNot all reported figures will sum exactly, particularly in the denominator of the LCR. For example, \"total net cash outflows\" (row 22) may not be exactly equal to \"total cash outflows\" minus \"total cash inflows\" (row 16 minus row 20) if the cap on inflows is binding.

This contradicts the presentation for credit risk and securitisation (rows 16-19). Should line items be added (where to reconcile the disclosure to the total RWA? \n\nnecessary) \n\n(rows \n\n1-5) \n\nTemplate OV1 does not request CCR to be split by risk weighting methodology, but by EAD methodology. Nevertheless, banks should add extra rows, as appropriate, to split the exposures by risk weighting methodology*, in order to facilitate the reconciliation with the RWA changes in Template CCR7. \n\n* RWA and capital requirements under the Standardised Approach for credit risk weighting are to be subdivided in the standardised approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR) and the internal models method (IMM), and the same for RWA and capital requirements under the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach for credit risk weighting. \n\nComposition of capital TLAC \n\nthe \n\ndisclosure For requirements under section 14 in the event a bank its prior year restates accounting balance sheet, does the bank restate the archived year reconciliation templates? \n\nprior \n\nto \n\nthe \n\nreconciliation \n\nThe requirement to keep an archive of a minimum period also applies such, any prospective/retrospective restatement of the balance sheet would require similar amendments to be reflected in the reconciliation templates within the archive with a clear indication that such a revision has been made. \n\ntemplate.

Some examples are shown below: - Goodwill and intangible assets: the amount to be disclosed in column (g) is the amount of any goodwill or intangibles,* including any goodwill included in the valuation of significant investments in the capital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory consolidation. The amount disclosed in the assets rows is net of any associated deferred tax liability which would be extinguished if the intangible assets become impaired or derecognised under the relevant accounting standards. The associated deferred tax liability is also to be disclosed in the liabilities rows of column (g). - Deferred tax assets: for all types of deferred tax assets to be deducted from own funds, the amount to be disclosed in column (g) is net of associated deferred tax liabilities that are eligible for netting. The associated deferred tax liabilities are to be disclosed in the liabilities rows of column (g). For deferred tax assets, for which the deduction is subject to a threshold, the amount disclosed in column (g) in the assets rows is the amount, net of any eligible deferred tax liability, above the threshold. The associated deferred tax liabilities are also to be disclosed in the liabilities rows of column (g). - Defined benefit pension fund assets: the amount disclosed is net of any deferred tax liabilities which would be extinguished if the asset should become impaired or derecognised under the relevant accounting standards. These deferred tax liabilities are also to be disclosed in the liabilities rows of column (g). - Investments in own shares (treasury stock) or own instruments of regulatory capital: when investments in own shares or own instruments of regulatory capital are not already derecognised under the relevant accounting standards, the deducted amount disclosed is net of short positions in the same underlying exposure or in the same underlying index allowed to be netted under the Basel framework.

Should in any case deferred tax liabilities and defined benefit fund pension liabilities be included in column (g)? \n\nliabilities \n\nthe \n\n1,250% risk-weighted exposures should be disclosed in the relevant credit risk or securitisation risk templates. \n\nThe liabilities disclosed in column (g) are all liabilities under the regulatory scope of consolidation, except for the following, which are disclosed in columns (c), (d), (e) and (f) as applicable: liabilities that are included in the determination of the exposure values in the market risk or the counterparty credit risk framework; and liabilities that are eligible under the Basel netting rules. \n\nWhat is the difference in Template LI2 between the required disclosure in row 2 (Liabilities carrying value regulatory amount under scope of consolidation) and row 6 (Differences due to different netting rules, other than those already included in row 2). \n\nRow 2 refers to balance sheet netting, while row 6 refers to incremental netting in application of the Basel rules (when not already covered by balance sheet netting). The netting rules under the Basel framework are different from the rules under the applicable accounting frameworks. The incremental netting in row 6 could represent an additional deduction from the net exposure value before application of the Basel netting rules (when those rules lead to more netting than the balance sheet netting in row 2) or a gross-up of the net exposure value when the off-balance sheet netting operated in row 2 is broader than what the Basel netting rules allow. \n\nHow does the disclosure in Template LI2, in particular row 3 (total net amount under regulatory scope of consolidated) to accounting equity? \n\nrelate \n\nThe netting between assets and liabilities in Template LI2 does not lead to accounting equity under a regulatory scope of consolidation being disclosed in row 3. Assets and liabilities included in rows 1 and 2 are limited to those assets and liabilities that are taken into consideration in the regulatory framework. Other assets and liabilities not considered in the regulatory framework are to be disclosed in column (g) in Template LI1 and are consequently excluded from rows 1 and 2 of Template LI2. \n\nFor Template LI2, how would the entry in row 10 amounts (exposure \n\nIn general, under a regulatory scope of consolidation, the accounting carrying amount and the regulatory exposure value would vary due to the incidence of off-balance sheet elements, \n\nPillar 3 Disclosure Requirements Framework\n\nVersion Number\n\n\nIssue Date\n\n\nPage Number 159 of 168 \n\n\n\nprovisions, and different netting and measurement rules. Under market risk, the regulatory exposure value will also differ from the accounting carrying amount. Differences could be due to off-balance sheet items, netting rules and different measurement rules of market risk positions via prudent valuation (as opposed to fair valuation in the applicable accounting framework). \n\nscope \n\nconsidered for regulatory purpose) differ from the balance sheet values under a of regulatory consolidation? Is it correct that there would be no differences to be explained, given that market risk does not have exposure values and the linkage for the other risk categories does not apply? \n\nCredit risk \n\nHow should the disclosure be made in Template CR3, in an example where a loan has multiple types of credit risk mitigation is overcollateralised (eg a loan of 100 with land collateral of 120 as well as guarantees of 50)? \n\nand \n\nWhen an exposure benefits from multiple types of credit risk mitigation mechanisms, the exposure value should be allocated to each mechanism by order of priority based on the credit risk mitigation mechanism which banks would apply in the event of loss. Disclosure should be limited to the value of the exposure (ie the amount of overcollateralisation does not need to be disclosed in the table). If the bank wishes to disclose information regarding the over-collateralisation, it may do so in the accompanying narrative. Refer to example in section 28.3. \n\n19 \n\nWhat are the values to be collateral, ascribed to credit and guarantees derivatives in Template CR3? \n\nWhere should exposures to central counterparties (CCPs) be included? \n\nBanks should disclose the amount of credit risk mitigation calculated according to the regulatory framework, including both the costs to sell and of haircut. \n\nfor \n\ntrades, \n\nincluded \n\ninitial margins and default \n\nfund Exposures contributions are in Template CCR8. Exposures stemming from loans to CCPs excluding initial margins and default fund contributions should be included within the credit risk framework considering the CCP as an asset class item. These loans should be included in the exposure class where the national \n\nPillar 3 Disclosure Requirements Framework\n\nVersion Number\n\n\nIssue Date\n\n\nPage Number 160 of 168 \n\n\n\nimplementation of the Basel framework allows exposures to CCPs to be included. \n\nUnder the IRB approach, credit derivatives are recognised as CRM techniques for the F-IRB and A-IRB. In both cases, banks can reflect the risk mitigating effect of credit derivatives on an exposure by adjusting their PD or loss-given-default (LGD). Banks should disclose in column (a), the RWA of an exposure secured by a credit derivative calculated without reflecting the risk mitigating effect of credit derivatives (in the example, banks would disclose 150 SAR). In column (b), the RWA of the same exposure calculated reflecting the risk mitigating effect of credit derivatives (in the example, banks would disclose 30*50% + 70*150% = 120) should be disclosed. \n\na \n\na \n\nby \n\nIn Template CR7, what is the required disclosure if an exposure is only partially hedged credit instance, derivative? For consider loan with nominal exposure of 100 SAR, risk weight of 150% and therefore RWA of 150 SAR. The bank buys a credit default swap with a 30 SAR nominal amount, and the risk weight of the protection provider is 50%. Which values should be entered in columns (a) and (b)? \n\nIs the \"weighted average (d) of in column PD\" be Template CR9 to the calculated based on ∑(PDί formula *EADί)/(∑EADί)? \n\nshould \n\nHow \"defaulted obligors\" be defined, for the purpose of Template CR9? For column (f) (number of obligors), please clarify how \"obligors\" are defined from a retail perspective. Should \"end of the previous year\" include only non-defaulted accounts at the beginning of the year, or both defaulted non-defaulted and accounts? Should \"end of \n\n\"Weighted\" means exposure at default (EAD)-weighted. For this purpose, the formula in the question is correct since the data will be comparable to those reported in column (i). \n\nThe definition of obligors or retail obligors is the same as for other obligors; any individual person or persons, or a small or medium-sized entity. Furthermore, where banks apply the \"transaction approach\", each transaction shall be considered as a single obligor. A defaulted obligor is an obligor that meets the conditions set out in SCRE16.67 to SCRE16.74. \n\nFor column (f), the \"end of the previous year\" includes non-defaulted accounts at the beginning of the year of reference for disclosure. The \"end of the year\" includes all the non-defaulted accounts related to obligors already included in the \"end of the previous year\" plus all the new obligors acquired during the year of reference for disclosure which did not go into default during the \n\nPillar 3 Disclosure Requirements Framework\n\nVersion Number\n\n\nIssue Date\n\n\nPage Number 161 of 168 \n\n\n\ncolumn \n\nthe year\" include all active accounts at the end of the year? For (g) (defaulted obligors in the year), please clarify whether it is related to accounts that defaulted during the year or from inception. \n\na \n\nWhat considerations can institutions reference when model disclosing performance test (backtesting) when the test is not aligned to the year-end disclosure timetable? \n\nyear. Banks have discretion as to whether to include obligors who left during the year within the \"end of the year\" number. \n\nFor column (g), \"defaulted obligors\" includes: (i) obligors not in default at the beginning of the year who went into default during the year; and (ii) new obligors acquired during the year- through origination or purchase of loans, debt securities or off-balance sheet commitments - that were not in default, but which went into default during the year. Obligors under (ii) are also separately disclosed in column (h). The PD or PD range to be included in columns (d) and (e) is the one assigned at the beginning of the period for obligors that are not in default at the beginning of the period. \n\nThe frequency of the disclosure is not linked to the timing of the bank's backtesting. The annual disclosure frequency does not require a timetable of model backtesting that is calibrated on a calendar year basis. When the backtesting reference period is not calibrated on a calendar year basis, but on another time interval (for instance, a 12- month interval), \"year\" as used in columns (f), (g) and (h) of Template CR9 means \"over the period used for the backtesting of a model\". Banks must, however, disclose the time horizon (observation period /timetable) they use for their backtesting. \n\nCounterparty credit risk \n\nThe numbers reported in Template CCR5 should be the total collateral posted/received (ie not limited to the collateral that is applied/used for risk mitigation). The purpose of the template is to provide a view on the collateral posted/received rather than the value accounted for within the regulatory computation. If the bank wishes to disclose the collateral eligible for credit mitigation, it may do so using an accompanying narrative. \n\n20 \n\nThe \"purpose\" of Template CCR5 asks for a breakdown of all types of collateral posted or received. The content section, however, asks for collateral used. These numbers differ as are certain over-collateralised (ie >100% of exposure) and therefore not all collateral would be used for risk the mitigation. all template \n\nShould include \n\ntransactions \n\nPillar 3 Disclosure Requirements Framework\n\nVersion Number\n\n\nIssue Date\n\n\nPage Number 162 of 168 \n\n\n\ncollateral posted/received or just is applied? \n\ncollateral \n\nthat \n\nTemplate CCR7 is consistent with Template OV1, which requests a split by exposure at default (EAD) methodology and not by risk weighting methodology. Banks are recommended to add rows to report any changes relating to risk weighting methodology if they deem them useful. The row breakdown is flexible and intends to depict all the significant drivers of changes for the risk-weighted assets (RWA) under counterparty credit risk. Specific rows should be inserted when changes to the IRB model result in changes to the RWA of instruments under counterparty credit risk whose exposure value is determined based on the IMM. \n\nTemplate CCR7 refers to an internal RWA flow on models method (IMM) exposures. Row 4 (Model updates - IMM only) and row 5 (Methodology and policy - IMM only) are specifically to include only model and methodology/policy changes relating to the IMM exposures model. Where in the template would changes to the internal-ratings based (IRB) models that result in changes in risk weights for positions under the IMM be reported? \n\nTemplate SEC1 requires the disclosure \"carrying of values\". Is there a direct link between columns (d), (h) and (l) of Template SEC1 and column (e) of Template LI1? \n\n21 \n\nSecuritisation \n\nReconciliation is not possible when Template SEC1 presents securitisation exposures within and outside the securitisation framework together. However, when banks choose to disclose Template SEC1 and SEC2 separately for securitisation exposures within the securitisation framework and outside that framework, the following reconciliation is possible: the sum of on-balance sheet assets and liabilities included in columns (d), (h) and (l) of Template SEC1 is equal to the amounts disclosed in column (e) of Template LI1. \n\nShould institutions disclose RWA before or after the application of the cap? \n\nRWA figures disclosed in Templates SEC3 and SEC4 should be before application of the cap, as it is useful for users to compare exposures and risk-weighted assets (RWA) before application of the cap. Columns (a)-(m) in Templates SEC3 and SEC4 should be \n\nPillar 3 Disclosure Requirements Framework\n\nVersion Number\n\n\nIssue Date\n\n\nPage Number 163 of 168 \n\n\n\nreported prior to application of the cap, while columns (n)-(q) should be reported after application of the cap.
