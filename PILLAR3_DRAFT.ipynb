RWA density provides a synthetic metric on the riskiness of each portfolio. Scope of application: The template is mandatory for banks using the standardised approach for credit risk. Subject to SAMA approval of the immateriality of the asset class, banks that intend to adopt a phased rollout of the IRB approach may apply the standardised approach to certain asset classes. In circumstances where exposures and RWA amounts subject to the standardised approach may be considered to be negligible, and disclosure of this information to users would not provide any meaningful information, the bank may choose not to disclose the template for the exposures treated under the standardised approach. The bank must, however, explain why it considers the information not to be meaningful to users. The explanation must include a description of the exposures included in the respective portfolios and the aggregate total of RWA from such exposures. Content: Regulatory exposure amounts Frequency: Semiannual. Format: Fixed. The columns and rows cannot be altered unless SAMA make policy changes to the asset classes as defined under the finalised Basel III framework. Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant change over the reporting period and the key drivers of such changes. Banks should describe the sequence in which CCFs, provisioning and credit risk mitigation measures are applied.</td>\n",

Scope of application: This template is mandatory for all G-SIBs. It should be completed at the level of each resolution group within a G-SIB. Content: Carrying values (corresponding to the values reported in financial statements). Frequency: Semiannual. Format: Fixed. Accompanying narrative: G-SIBs are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant changes over the reporting period and the key drivers of any such change(s).

In particular, the template compares the PD used in IRB capital calculations with the effective default rates of bank obligors. A minimum five-year average annual default rate is required to compare the PD with a \"more stable\" default rate, although a bank may use a longer historical period that is consistent with its actual risk management practices. Scope of application: he template is mandatory for banks using the A-IRB and/or F-IRB approaches. Where a bank makes use of a F-IRB approach for certain exposures and an A-IRB approach for others, it must disclose two separate sets of portfolio breakdown in separate templates.  \n",
       "34  Standardised approach - credit risk exposure and credit risk mitigation (CRM) effects Purpose: To illustrate the effect of CRM (comprehensive and simple approach) on capital requirement calculations under the standardised approach for credit risk. RWA density provides a synthetic metric on the riskiness of each portfolio. Scope of application: The template is mandatory for banks using the standardised approach for credit risk. Subject to SAMA approval of the immateriality of the asset class, banks that intend to adopt a phased rollout of the IRB approach may apply the standardised approach to certain asset classes. In circumstances where exposures and RWA amounts subject to the standardised approach may be considered to be negligible, and disclosure of this information to users would not provide any meaningful information, the bank may choose not to disclose the template for the exposures treated under the standardised approach. The bank must, however, explain why it considers the information not to be meaningful to users. The explanation must include a description of the exposures included in the respective portfolios and the aggregate total of RWA from such exposures. Content: Regulatory exposure amounts Frequency: Semiannual. Format: Fixed. The columns and rows cannot be altered unless SAMA make policy changes to the asset classes as defined under the finalised Basel III framework. Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant change over the reporting period and the key drivers of such changes.

Scope of application: The table is mandatory for all banks. Content: Carrying values. Banks must include all CRM techniques used to reduce capital requirements and disclose all secured exposures, irrespective of whether the standardised or IRB approach is used for RWA calculation. Please refer to section 28.3 for an illustration on how the template should be completed. Frequency: Semiannual. Format: Fixed. Where banks are unable to categorise exposures secured by collateral, financial guarantees or credit derivative into \"loans\" and \"debt securities\", they can either (i) merge two corresponding cells, or (ii) divide the amount by the pro-rata weight of gross carrying values; they must explain which method they have used. Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant changes over the reporting period and the key drivers of such changes.  \n",

Scope of application: he table is mandatory for banks using A-IRB or F-IRB approaches for some or all of their exposures. To provide meaningful information to users, the bank must describe the main characteristics of the models used at the group-wide level (according to the scope of regulatory consolidation) and explain how the scope of models described was determined. The commentary must include the percentage of RWA covered by the models for each of the bank's regulatory portfolios. Content: Qualitative information. Frequency: Annual. Format: Flexible.  \n",

Scope of application: The template is mandatory for banks having part or all of their market risk capital requirements measured according to the standardised approach. For banks that use the internal models approach (IMA), the standardised approach capital requirement in this template must be calculated based on the portfolios in trading desks that do not use the IMA (ie trading desks that are not deemed eligible to use the IMA per the terms of SMAR10.4). Content: Capital requirements (as defined in SMAR6 to SMAR9). Frequency: Semiannual. Format: Fixed. Additional rows can be added for the breakdown of other risks. Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant change over the reporting period and the key drivers of such changes. In particular, the narrative should inform about changes in the scope of application, including changes due to trading desks for which capital requirements are calculated using the standardised approach.  \n",

Scope of application: The table is mandatory for all banks. Content: Carrying values. Banks must include all CRM techniques used to reduce capital requirements and disclose all secured exposures, irrespective of whether the standardised or IRB approach is used for RWA calculation. Please refer to section 28.3 for an illustration on how the template should be completed. Frequency: Semiannual. Format: Fixed. Where banks are unable to categorise exposures secured by collateral, financial guarantees or credit derivative into \"loans\" and \"debt securities\", they can either (i) merge two corresponding cells, or (ii) divide the amount by the pro-rata weight of gross carrying values; they must explain which method they have used. Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant changes over the reporting period and the key drivers of such changes.  \n",

       "22  Standardised approach - credit risk exposure and credit risk mitigation (CRM) effects Purpose: To illustrate the effect of CRM (comprehensive and simple approach) on capital requirement calculations under the standardised approach for credit risk. RWA density provides a synthetic metric on the riskiness of each portfolio. Scope of application: The template is mandatory for banks using the standardised approach for credit risk. Subject to SAMA approval of the immateriality of the asset class, banks that intend to adopt a phased rollout of the IRB approach may apply the standardised approach to certain asset classes. In circumstances where exposures and RWA amounts subject to the standardised approach may be considered to be negligible, and disclosure of this information to users would not provide any meaningful information, the bank may choose not to disclose the template for the exposures treated under the standardised approach. The bank must, however, explain why it considers the information not to be meaningful to users. The explanation must include a description of the exposures included in the respective portfolios and the aggregate total of RWA from such exposures. Content: Regulatory exposure amounts Frequency: Semiannual. Format: Fixed. The columns and rows cannot be altered unless SAMA make policy changes to the asset classes as defined under the finalised Basel III framework.

In particular, the template compares the PD used in IRB capital calculations with the effective default rates of bank obligors. A minimum five-year average annual default rate is required to compare the PD with a \"more stable\" default rate, although a bank may use a longer historical period that is consistent with its actual risk management practices. Scope of application: he template is mandatory for banks using the A-IRB and/or F-IRB approaches. Where a bank makes use of a F-IRB approach for certain exposures and an A-IRB approach for others, it must disclose two separate sets of portfolio breakdown in separate templates.  \n",

Scope of application: This template is mandatory for all banks. Content: Notional derivative amounts (before any netting) and fair values. Frequency: Semiannual. Format: Flexible (the columns are fixed but the rows are flexible). Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant changes over the reporting period and the key drivers of such changes.  \n",

Scope of application: The template is mandatory for banks having part or all of their market risk capital requirements measured according to the standardised approach. For banks that use the internal models approach (IMA), the standardised approach capital requirement in this template must be calculated based on the portfolios in trading desks that do not use the IMA (ie trading desks that are not deemed eligible to use the IMA per the terms of SMAR10.4). Content: Capital requirements (as defined in SMAR6 to SMAR9). Frequency: Semiannual. Format: Fixed. Additional rows can be added for the breakdown of other risks. Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant change over the reporting period and the key drivers of such changes. In particular, the narrative should inform about changes in the scope of application, including changes due to trading desks for which capital requirements are calculated using the standardised approach.  \n",
