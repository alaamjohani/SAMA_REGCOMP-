      "3. | Where consolidation of a subsidiary is not feasible 6 , banks are required to seek SAMA’s approval to exclude the subsidiary from the scope of application and reporting requirements. The application should include proper justifications and risk management controls to ensure group risks are managed effectively.\n",
      "4. | Subject to SAMA discretion, the framework may apply to the bank subsidiaries at every tier or level within the banking group on a consolidated and/or on standalone basis, as applicable. In this regard, SAMA will, among others, take into consideration the type of subsidiary 7 , quantitative and qualitative factors such as size of assets and liabilities, nature of business activities and inter-connectedness within the group.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. | For Pillar 2 purposes, SAMA applies its supervisory review process under Pillar 2 on a consolidated basis. This means SAMA’s supervisory assessment of banks’ risk management frameworks, capital and liquidity planning and adequacy will consider the nature and significance of business activities and associated risks of the subsidiaries, which are consolidated and not consolidated and their impact to the local bank and the overall banking group. This is consistent with SAMA’s consolidated supervision objective to ensure that risks within a banking group are adequately captured. In this regard, SAMA may also apply its supervisory discretion in extending the scope of application of other relevant prudential requirements, if warranted.\n",

For this purpose, banks shall use the relevant templates for the reporting of these prudential returns to SAMA.\n",
      "10. | Where reporting on standalone (e.g. reporting of risk-weighted assets, minimum regulatory capital and liquidity requirements at the bank entity level) is not feasible, banks are required to seek SAMA’s supervisory approval on a yearly basis for exemption from reporting on standalone basis. The application for exemption should include proper justifications and risk management controls to ensure risks are managed effectively.\n",
      "11. | Each consolidated subsidiary is not required to report its prudential returns to SAMA on a standalone basis. However, SAMA would expect the bank to have full risk oversight of its group’s subsidiary activities and be adequately informed of capital and liquidity adequacy of the overall group, including its major subsidiaries.\n",
      "12. | SAMA expect banks to have access to information on the activities and risk exposures of all their subsidiaries and attribute these risk exposures to the consolidated subsidiaries at all times. Banks are required to have internal systems to support the group-wide risk monitoring and reporting and to provide the information, as and when, required by SAMA.\n",

      "1.1 | The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the Basel III: Finalizing post-crisis reforms in December 2017, which includes among others, the revised framework for Credit Risk aimed to enhance the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches, balances simplicity of the framework and, comparability in the calculation of risk weighted assets (RWAs) for credit risk using different available approaches.\n",
      "1.2 | This revised framework in risk-weighted assets for credit risk is issued by SAMA in exercise of the authority vested in SAMA under the Charter issued via Royal Decree No. M/36 dated 11/04/1442H , and the Banking Control Law issued 01/01/1386H .\n",
      "1.3 | This revised framework on risk-weighted assets for credit risk will supersede the following existing requirements related to the calculation of RWAs for credit risk:\n",

      "2.1 | This framework applies to all domestic banks both on a consolidated basis, which include all branches and subsidiaries, and on a standalone basis.\n",
      "2.2 | This framework is not applicable to foreign banks’ branches operating in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the branches shall comply with the regulatory capital requirements stipulated by their respective home regulators.\n",
      "\n",
      "5.1 | Banks can choose between two broad methodologies for calculating their risk-based capital requirements for credit risk. The first is the standardized approach, which is set out in chapters 6 to 9 : | \n",
      " | i. | The standardized approach assigns standardized risk weights to exposures as described in chapter 7 . Risk weighted assets are calculated as the product of the standardized risk weights and the exposure amount. Exposures should be risk-weighted net of specific provisions (including partial write-offs).\n",
      " | ii. | To determine the risk weights in the standardized approach for certain exposure classes, banks may, as a starting point, use assessments by external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs) that are recognized as eligible for capital purposes by SAMA. The requirements covering the use of external ratings are set out in chapter 8 . 1\n",
      " | iii. | The credit risk mitigation techniques that are permitted to be recognized under the standardized approach are set out in chapter 9 .\n",
      "5.2 | The second risk-weighted assets approach is the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, which allows banks to use their internal rating systems for credit risk. The IRB approach is set out in chapters 10 to 16 . Banks must seek SAMA’s regulatory approval before they can use the IRB Approach for calculation of capital requirements for credit risk, subject to the Bank meeting all minimum requirements for the use of IRB Approach, supervisory review and validation exercise as may be carried out by SAMA. | \n",
      "5.3 | This policy document also covers the treatment in banking book of the following exposures: | \n",
      " | 1. | Securitization exposures (chapters 18 to 23 );\n",
      " | 2. | Equity investments in funds ( chapter 24 ); and\n",
      " | 3. | Exposures arising from unsettled transactions and failed trades ( chapter 25 ).\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1 | Banks must perform due diligence to ensure that they have an adequate understanding, at origination and thereafter on a regular basis (at least annually), of the risk profile and characteristics of their counterparties. In cases where ratings are used, due diligence is necessary to assess the risk of the exposure for risk management purposes and whether the risk weight applied is appropriate and prudent. The sophistication of the due diligence should be appropriate to the size and complexity of banks’ activities. Banks must take reasonable and adequate steps to assess the operating and financial performance levels and trends through internal credit analysis and/or other analytics outsourced to a third party, as appropriate for each counterparty. Banks must be able to access information about their counterparties on a regular basis to complete due diligence analyses.\n",
      "6.2 | For exposures to entities belonging to consolidated groups, due diligence should, to the extent possible, be performed at the solo entity level to which there is a credit exposure. In evaluating the repayment capacity of the solo entity, banks are expected to take into account the support of the group and the potential for it to be adversely impacted by problems in the group.\n",
      "6.3 | Banks should have in place effective internal policies, processes, systems and controls to ensure that the appropriate risk weights are assigned to counterparties. Banks must be able to demonstrate to SAMA that their due diligence analyses are appropriate.\n",

Underwriting policies must define a metric(s) (such as the loan’s debt service coverage ratio) and specify its (their) corresponding relevant level(s) to conduct such assessment 22 .

The primary source of these cash flows would generally be lease or rental payments, or the sale of the property. The distinguishing characteristic of these exposures compared to other regulatory real estate exposures is that both the servicing of the loan and the prospects for recovery in the event of default depend materially on the cash flows generated by the property securing the exposure.\n",

Under the loan splitting approach, the risk weight of 20% is applied to the part of the exposure up to 55% of the property value and the risk weight of the counterparty (as prescribed in paragraph 7.81) is applied to the residual exposure 29 .

For example, for a loan of SAR 70,000 to an individual secured on a property valued at SAR 100,000, where there is also a senior ranking lien of SAR 10,000 held by another institution, the bank will apply a risk weight of 20% to SAR 45,000 (=max (SAR 55,000 – SAR 10,000, 0)) of the exposure and, according to paragraph 7.81 a risk weight of 75% to the residual exposure of SAR 25,000.

      " |  | The methodology for assigning external ratings must be rigorous, systematic, and subject to some form of validation based on historical experience. Moreover, external ratings must be subject to ongoing review and responsive to changes in financial condition. Before being recognized by SAMA, a rating methodology for each market segment, including rigorous back testing, must have been established for at least one year and preferably three years.\n",
      " | (2) | Independence :\n",
      " |  | An ECAI should be independent and should not be subject to political or economic pressures that may influence the rating. In particular, an ECAI should not delay or refrain from taking a rating action based on its potential effect (economic, political or otherwise). The rating process should be as free as possible from any constraints that could arise in situations where the composition of the board of directors or the shareholder structure of the credit rating agency may be seen as creating a conflict of interest. Furthermore, an ECAI should separate operationally, legally and, if practicable, physically its rating business from other businesses and analysts.\n",
      " | (3) | International access/transparency:\n",
      " |  | The individual ratings, the key elements underlining the ratings assessments and whether the issuer participated in the rating process should be publicly available on a non-selective basis, unless they are private ratings, which should be at least available to both domestic and foreign institutions with legitimate interest and on equivalent terms. In addition, the ECAI’s general procedures, methodologies and assumptions for arriving at ratings should be publicly available.\n",
      " | (4) | Disclosure:\n",
      " |  | An ECAI should disclose the following information: its code of conduct; the general nature of its compensation arrangements with assessed entities; any conflict of interest, the ECAI's compensation arrangements, its rating assessment methodologies, including the definition of default, the time horizon, and the meaning of each rating; the actual default rates experienced in each assessment category; and the transitions of the ratings, e.g. the likelihood of AA ratings becoming A over time. A rating should be disclosed as soon as practicably possible after issuance. When disclosing a rating, the information should be provided in plain language, indicating the nature and limitation of credit ratings and the risk of unduly relying on them to make investments.\n",
      " | (5) | Resources :\n",
      " |  | An ECAI should have sufficient resources to carry out high-quality credit assessments. These resources should allow for substantial ongoing contact with senior and operational levels within the entities assessed in order to add value to the credit assessments. In particular, ECAIs should assign analysts with appropriate knowledge and experience to assess the creditworthiness of the type of entity or obligation being rated. Such assessments should be based on methodologies combining qualitative and quantitative approaches.\n",
      " | (6) | Credibility :\n",
      " |  | To some extent, credibility is derived from the criteria above. In addition, the reliance on an ECAI’s external ratings by independent parties (investors, insurers, trading partners) is evidence of the credibility of the ratings of an ECAI. The credibility of an ECAI is also underpinned by the existence of internal procedures to prevent the misuse of confidential information. In order to be eligible for recognition, an ECAI does not have to assess firms in more than one country.\n",
      " | (7) | Cooperation with SAMA:\n",
      " |  | ECAIs should notify SAMA of significant changes to methodologies and provide access to external ratings and other relevant data in order to support initial and continued determination of eligibility.\n",

      " | (1) | In circumstances where the borrower has a specific rating for an issued debt – but the bank’s exposure is not an investment in this particular debt – a high-quality credit rating (one which maps into a risk weight lower than that which applies to an unrated exposure) on that specific debt may only be applied to the bank’s unrated exposure if this exposure ranks in all respects pari passu or senior to the exposure with a rating. If not, the external rating cannot be used and the unassessed exposure will receive the risk weight for unrated exposures.\n",
      " | (2) | In circumstances where the borrower has an issuer rating, this rating typically applies to senior unsecured exposures to that issuer. Consequently, only senior exposures to that issuer will benefit from a high-quality issuer rating. Other unassessed exposures of a highly rated issuer will be treated as unrated. If either the issuer or a single issue has a low-quality rating (mapping into a risk weight equal to or higher than that which applies to unrated exposures), an unassessed exposure to the same counterparty that ranks pari passu or is subordinated to either the senior unsecured issuer rating or the exposure with a low-quality rating will be assigned the same risk weight as is applicable to the low-quality rating.\n",
      " | (3) | In circumstances where the issuer has a specific high-quality rating (one which maps into a lower risk weight) that only applies to a limited class of liabilities (such as a deposit rating or a counterparty risk rating), this may only be used in respect of exposures that fall within that class.\n",
      "8.14 | Whether the bank intends to rely on an issuer- or an issue-specific rating, the rating must take into account and reflect the entire amount of credit risk exposure the bank has with regard to all payments owed to it. For example, if a bank is owed both principal and interest, the rating must fully take into account and reflect the credit risk associated with repayment of both principal and interest.\n",

They cannot be generalized to other short-term exposures, except under the conditions in paragraph 8.19. In no event can a short-term rating be used to support a risk weight for an unrated long-term exposure. Short-term ratings may only be used for short-term exposures against banks and corporates.

      " | (2) | When there is a short-term rating and such a rating maps into a risk weight that is more favorable (i.e. lower) or identical to that derived from the general preferential treatment, the short-term rating should be used for the specific exposure only. Other short-term exposures would benefit from the general preferential treatment.\n",
      " | (3) | When a specific short-term rating for a short term exposure to a bank maps into a less favorable (higher) risk weight, the general short-term preferential treatment for interbank exposures cannot be used.

      "9.4 | The requirements of chapter 19 in Pillar 3 Disclosure Requirements Framework must be fulfilled for banks to obtain capital relief in respect of any CRM techniques.\n",
      "9.5 | The effects of CRM must not be double-counted. Therefore, no additional supervisory recognition of CRM for regulatory capital purposes will be granted on exposures for which the risk weight already reflects that CRM. Consistent with paragraph 8.14 , principal-only ratings will also not be allowed within the CRM framework.\n",
      "9.6 | While the use of CRM techniques reduces or transfers credit risk, it may simultaneously increase other risks (i.e. residual risks). Residual risks include legal, operational, liquidity and market risks. Therefore, banks must employ robust procedures and processes to control these risks, including strategy; consideration of the underlying credit; valuation; policies and procedures; systems; control of roll-off risks; and management of concentration risk arising from the bank’s use of CRM techniques and its interaction with the bank’s overall credit risk profile. Where these risks are not adequately controlled, SAMA may impose additional capital charges or take other supervisory actions in the supervisory review process.\n",
      "9.7 | In order for CRM techniques to provide protection, the credit quality of the counterparty must not have a material positive correlation with the employed CRM technique or with the resulting residual risks (as defined in paragraph 9.6). For example, securities issued by the counterparty (or by any counterparty- related entity) provide little protection as collateral and are thus ineligible.\n",
      "9.8 | In the case where a bank has multiple CRM techniques covering a single exposure(e.g. a bank has both collateral and a guarantee partially covering an exposure), the bank must subdivide the exposure into portions covered by each type of CRM technique (e.g. portion covered by collateral, portion covered by guarantee) and the risk-weighted assets of each portion must be calculated separately. When credit protection provided by a single protection provider has differing maturities, they must be subdivided into separate protection as well.\n",
      "Legal requirements\n",
      "9.9 | In order for banks to obtain capital relief for any use of CRM techniques, all documentation used in collateralized transactions, on-balance sheet netting agreements, guarantees and credit derivatives must be binding on all parties and legally enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. Banks must have conducted sufficient legal review to verify this and have a well-founded legal basis to reach this conclusion, and undertake such further review as necessary to ensure continuing enforceability.\n",

      "General treatment of maturity mismatches | \n",
      "9.10 | For the purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets, a maturity mismatch occurs when the residual maturity of a credit protection arrangement (e.g. hedge) is less than that of the underlying exposure. | \n",
      "9.11 | In the case of financial collateral, maturity mismatches are not allowed under the simple approach (see paragraph 9.33 ). | \n",
      "9.12 | Under the other approaches, when there is a maturity mismatch the credit protection arrangement may only be recognized if the original maturity of the arrangement is greater than or equal to one year, and its residual maturity is greater than or equal to three months. In such cases, credit risk mitigation may be partially recognized as detailed below in paragraph 9.13. | \n",
      "9.13 | When there is a maturity mismatch with recognized credit risk mitigants, the following adjustment applies, where: | \n",
      " | (1) | P a = value of the credit protection adjusted for maturity mismatch\n",
      " | (2) | P = credit protection amount (e.g. collateral amount, guarantee amount)adjusted for any haircuts\n",
      " | (3) | t = min {T, residual maturity of the credit protection arrangement expressed in years}\n",
      " | (4) | T = min {five years, residual maturity of the exposure expressed in years}\n",
      " |  | [EQUATION]\n",
      "9.14 | The maturity of the underlying exposure and the maturity of the hedge must both be defined conservatively. The effective maturity of the underlying must be gauged as the longest possible remaining time before the counterparty is scheduled to fulfil its obligation, taking into account any applicable grace period. For the hedge, (embedded) options that may reduce the term of the hedge must be taken into account so that the shortest possible effective maturity is used. For example: where, in the case of a credit derivative, the protection seller has a call option, the maturity is the first call date. Likewise, if the protection buyer owns the call option and has a strong incentive to call the transaction at the first call date, for example because of a step-up in cost from this date on, the effective maturity is the remaining time to the first call date. | \n",

      "9.15 | Currency mismatches are allowed under all approaches. Under the simple approach there is no specific treatment for currency mismatches, given that a minimum risk weight of 20% (floor) is generally applied.

      "9.22 | Where guarantees or credit derivatives fulfil the minimum operational conditions set out in paragraphs 9.69 to 9.71 , banks may take account of the credit protection offered by such credit risk mitigation techniques in calculating capital requirements.\n",
      "9.23 | A range of guarantors and protection providers are recognized and a substitution approach applies for capital requirement calculations. Only guarantees issued by or protection provided by entities with a lower risk weight than the counterparty lead to reduced capital charges for the guaranteed exposure, since the protected portion of the counterparty exposure is assigned the risk weight of the guarantor or protection provider, whereas the uncovered portion retains the risk weight of the underlying counterparty.\n",

Banks that lend securities or post collateral must calculate capital requirements for both of the following: (i) the credit risk or market risk of the securities, if this remains with the bank; and (ii) the counterparty credit risk arising from the risk that the borrower of the securities may default.\n",
      "9.26 | The legal mechanism by which collateral is pledged or transferred must ensure that the bank has the right to liquidate or take legal possession of it, in a timely manner, in the event of the default, insolvency or bankruptcy (or one or more otherwise-defined credit events set out in the transaction documentation) of the counterparty (and, where applicable, of the custodian holding the collateral). Additionally, banks must take all steps necessary to fulfil those requirements under the law applicable to the bank’s interest in the collateral for obtaining and maintaining an enforceable security interest, e.g. by registering it with a registrar, or for exercising a right to net or set off in relation to the title transfer of the collateral.\n",

      "9.40 | In the comprehensive approach, when taking collateral, banks must calculate their adjusted exposure to a counterparty in order to take account of the risk mitigating effect of that collateral. Banks must use the applicable supervisory haircuts to adjust both the amount of the exposure to the counterparty and the value of any collateral received in support of that counterparty to take account of possible future fluctuations in the value of either 45 , as occasioned by market movements. Unless either side of the transaction is cash or a zero haircut is applied, the volatility-adjusted exposure amount is higher than the nominal exposure and the volatility-adjusted collateral value is lower than the nominal collateral value.\n",
      "9.41 | The size of the haircuts that banks must use depends on the prescribed holding period for the transaction. For the purposes of chapter 9 ,the holding period is the period of time over which exposure or collateral values are assumed to move before the bank can close out the transaction. The supervisory prescribed minimum holding period is used as the basis for the calculation of the standard supervisory haircuts.\n",
      "9.42 | The holding period, and thus the size of the individual haircuts depends on the type of instrument, type of transaction, residual maturity and the frequency of marking to market and remargining as provided in paragraphs 9.49 to 9.50. For example, repo-style transactions subject to daily marking-to-market and to daily remargining will receive a haircut based on a 5-business day holding period and secured lending transactions with daily mark-to-market and no remargining clauses will receive a haircut based on a 20-business day holding period. Haircuts must be scaled up using the square root of time formula depending on the actual frequency of remargining or marking to market. This formula is included in paragraph 9.58.\n",
      "9.43 | Additionally, where the exposure and collateral are held in different currencies, banks must apply an additional haircut to the volatility-adjusted collateral amount in accordance with paragraphs 9.51 and 9.81 to 0 to take account of possible future fluctuations in exchange rates.\n",
      "9.44 | The effect of master netting agreements covering securities financing transactions (SFTs) can be recognized for the calculation of capital requirements subject to the conditions and requirements in paragraphs 9.61 to 9.64 . Where SFTs are subject to a master netting agreement whether they are held in the banking book or trading book, a bank may choose not to recognize the netting effects in calculating capital.

Subject to certain minimum conditions and disclosure requirements, banks that have received SAMA’s approval to use the IRB approach may rely on their own internal estimates of risk components in determining the capital requirement for a given exposure. The risk components include measures of the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), the exposure at default (EAD), and effective maturity (M). In some cases, banks may be required to use a supervisory value as opposed to an internal estimate for one or more of the risk components.\n",
      "10.2 | The IRB approach is based on measures of unexpected losses (UL) and expected losses. The risk-weight functions, as outlined in chapter 11 , produce capital requirements for the UL portion. Expected losses are treated separately, as outlined in chapter 15 .\n",
      "10.3 | In this chapter, first the asset classes (e.g. corporate exposures and retail exposures) eligible for the IRB approach are defined. Second, there is a description of the risk components to be used by banks by asset class. Third, the requirements are outlined that relate to a bank’s adoption of the IRB approach at the asset class level and the related roll-out requirements. In cases where an IRB treatment is not specified, the risk weight for those other exposures is 100%, except when a 0% risk weight applies under the standardized approach, and the resulting risk-weighted assets are assumed to represent UL only. Moreover, banks must apply the risk weights referenced in paragraphs 7.53, 7.54 and 7.101 of the standardized approach to the exposures referenced in those paragraphs (that is, investments that are assessed against certain materiality thresholds).\n",

The classes of assets are (a) corporate, (b) sovereign, (c) bank, (d) retail, and (e) equity. Within the corporate asset class, five sub-classes of specialized lending are separately identified. Within the retail asset class, three sub-classes are separately identified. Within the corporate and retail asset classes, a distinct treatment for purchased receivables may also apply provided that certain conditions are met. For the equity asset class, the IRB approach is not permitted, as outlined further below.\n",

      "10.6 | In general, a corporate exposure is defined as a debt obligation of a corporation, partnership, or proprietorship. Banks are permitted to distinguish separately exposures to micro, small or medium-sized entities (MSME), as defined in paragraph 11.8 .\n",
      "10.7 | In addition to general corporates, within the corporate asset class five sub-classes of specialized lending (SL) are identified. Such lending possesses all the following characteristics, in legal form or economic substance:\n",
      " | (1) | The exposure is typically to an entity (often a special purpose vehicle (SPV)) that was created specifically to finance and/or operate physical assets,\n",
      " | (2) | The borrowing entity has little or no other material assets or activities, and therefore little or no independent capacity to repay the obligation, apart from the income that it receives from the asset(s) being financed;\n",
      " | (3) | The terms of the obligation give the lender a substantial degree of control over the asset(s) and the income that it generates; and\n",
      " | (4) | As a result of the preceding factors, the primary source of repayment of the obligation is the income generated by the asset(s), rather than the independent capacity of a broader commercial enterprise.\n",
      "10.8 | The five sub-classes of SL are project finance (PF), object finance (OF), commodities finance (CF), income-producing real estate (IPRE) lending, and high-volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE) lending. Each of these subclasses is defined below.\n",
      "Project Finance\n",
      "10.9 | PF is a method of funding in which the lender looks primarily to the revenues generated by a single project, both as the source of repayment and as security for the exposure. This type of financing is usually for large, complex and expensive installations that might include, for example, power plants, chemical processing plants, mines, transportation infrastructure, environment, and telecommunications infrastructure. Project finance may take the form of financing of the construction of a new capital installation, or refinancing of an existing installation, with or without improvements.\n",
      "10.10 | In such transactions, the lender is usually paid solely or almost exclusively out of the money generated by the contracts for the facility’s output, such as the electricity sold by a power plant. The borrower is usually an SPV that is not permitted to perform any function other than developing, owning, and operating the installation. The consequence is that repayment depends primarily on the project’s cash flow and on the collateral value of the project’s assets. In contrast, if repayment of the exposure depends primarily on a well-established, diversified, credit-worthy, contractually obligated end user for repayment, it is considered a secured exposure to that end-user.\n",
      "Object Finance\n",
      "10.11 | OF refers to a method of funding the acquisition of physical assets (e.g. ships, aircraft, satellites, railcars, or fleets) where the repayment of the exposure is dependent on the cash flows generated by the specific assets that have been financed and pledged or assigned to the lender. A primary source of these cash flows might be rental or lease contracts with one or several third parties. In contrast, if the exposure is to a borrower whose financial condition and debt servicing capacity enables it to repay the debt without undue reliance on the specifically pledged assets, the exposure should be treated as a collateralized corporate exposure.\n",
      "Commodities Finance\n",
      "10.12 | CF refers to structured short-term lending to finance reserves, inventories, or receivables of exchange-traded commodities (e.g. crude oil, metals, or crops), where the exposure will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the commodity and the borrower has no independent capacity to repay the exposure. This is the case when the borrower has no other activities and no other material assets on its balance sheet. The structured nature of the financing is designed to compensate for the weak credit quality of the borrower. The exposure’s rating reflects its self-liquidating nature and the lender’s skill in structuring the transaction rather than the credit quality of the borrower.\n",
      "10.13 | Such lending can be distinguished from exposures financing the reserves, inventories, or receivables of other more diversified corporate borrowers. Banks are able to rate the credit quality of the latter type of borrowers based on their broader ongoing operations. In such cases, the value of the commodity serves as a risk mitigant rather than as the primary source of repayment.\n",
      "Income-Producing Real Estate Lending\n",
      "10.14 | IPRE lending refers to a method of providing funding to real estate (such as, office buildings to let, retail space, multifamily residential buildings, industrial or warehouse space, or hotels) where the prospects for repayment and recovery on the exposure depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset. The primary source of these cash flows would generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the asset. The borrower may be, but is not required to be, an SPV, an operating company focused on real estate construction or holdings, or an operating company with sources of revenue other than real estate. The distinguishing characteristic of IPRE versus other corporate exposures that are collateralized by real estate is the strong positive correlation between the prospects for repayment of the exposure and the prospects for recovery in the event of default, with both depending primarily on the cash flows generated by a property.\n",
      "High-Volatility Commercial Real Estate Lending\n",
      "10.15 | HVCRE lending is the financing of commercial real estate that exhibits higher loss rate volatility (i.e. higher asset correlation) compared to other types of SL. HVCRE includes:\n",
      " | (1) | Commercial real estate exposures secured by properties of types that are categorized by SAMA as sharing higher volatilities in portfolio default rates;\n",
      " | (2) | Loans financing any of the land acquisition, development and construction (ADC) phases for properties of those types in such jurisdictions; and\n",
      " | (3) | Loans financing ADC of any other properties where the source of repayment at origination of the exposure is either the future uncertain sale of the property or cash flows whose source of repayment is substantially uncertain (e.g. the property has not yet been leased to the occupancy rate prevailing in that geographic market for that type of commercial real estate), unless the borrower has substantial equity at risk. Commercial ADC loans exempted from treatment as HVCRE loans on the basis of certainty of repayment or borrower equity are, however, ineligible for the additional reductions for SL exposures described in paragraph 13.4 .\n",

      "10.16 | This asset class covers all exposures to counterparties treated as sovereigns under the standardized approach. This includes sovereigns (and their central banks), certain public sector entities (PSEs) identified as sovereigns in the standardized approach, multilateral development banks (MDBs) that meet the criteria for a 0% risk weight and referred to in the first footnote in paragraph 7.9 , and the entities referred to in paragraph 7.4 .\n",

      "10.17 | This asset class covers exposures to banks as defined in paragraph 7.12 and those securities firms and other financial institutions set out in paragraph 7.36 that are treated as exposures to banks. Bank exposures also include covered bonds as defined in paragraph 7.29 as well as claims on all domestic PSEs that are not treated as exposures to sovereigns under the standardized approach, and MDBs that do not meet the criteria for a 0% risk weight under the standardized approach (i.e. MDBs that are not listed in paragraph 7.10 ). This asset class also includes exposures to the entities listed in this paragraph that are in the form of subordinated debt or regulatory capital instruments (which form their own asset class within the standardized approach), provided that such instruments: (i) do not fall within the scope of equity exposures as defined in paragraph 10.24 ; (ii) are not deducted from regulatory capital or risk-weighted at 250% according to Article 4.4 – Section A of SAMA Guidance Document Concerning the Implementation of Basel III (Circular No. 341000015689, Date: 19 December 2012) ; and (iii) are not risk weighted at 1250% according to paragraph 7.54 .\n",

      "10.19 | The criteria related to the nature of the borrower and value of the individual exposures are as follows:\n",
      " | (1) | Exposures to individuals - such as revolving credits and lines of credit (e.g. credit cards, overdrafts, or retail facilities secured by financial instruments) as well as personal term loans and leases (e.g. instalment loans, auto loans and leases, student and educational loans, personal finance, or other exposures with similar characteristics) – are generally eligible for retail treatment regardless of exposure size.\n",
      " | (2) | Where a loan is a residential mortgage (including first and subsequent liens, term loans and revolving home equity lines of credit) it is eligible for retail treatment regardless of exposure size so long as the credit is an exposure to an individual 51 .\n",
      " | (3) | Where loans are extended to MSMEs and managed as retail exposures they are eligible for retail treatment provided the total exposure of the banking group to a MSME borrower (on a consolidated basis where applicable) is less than SAR 4.46 million. MSMEs loans extended through or guaranteed by an individual are subject to the same exposure threshold.\n",
      "10.20 | The criteria related to the size of the pool of exposures are as follows:\n",
      " | (1) | The exposure must be one of a large pool of exposures, which are managed by the bank on a pooled basis.\n",
      " | (2) | Where a loan gives rise to a small business exposure below SAR 4 million, it may be treated as retail exposures if the bank treats such exposures in its internal risk management systems consistently over time and in the same manner as other retail exposures. This requires that such an exposure be originated in a similar manner to other retail exposures. Furthermore, it must not be managed individually in a way comparable to corporate exposures, but rather as part of a portfolio segment or pool of exposures with similar risk characteristics for purposes of risk assessment and quantification. However, this does not preclude retail exposures from being treated individually at some stages of the risk management process. The fact that an exposure is rated individually does not by itself deny the eligibility as a retail exposure.\n",
      "10.21 | Within the retail asset class category, banks are required to identify separately three sub-classes of exposures:\n",
      " | (1) | Residential mortgage loans, as defined above;\n",
      " | (2) | Qualifying revolving retail exposures, as defined in the following paragraph; and\n",
      " | (3) | All other retail exposures.\n",
      "\n",
      "Definition of qualifying revolving retail exposures\n",
      "10.22 | All of the following criteria must be satisfied for a sub-portfolio to be treated as a qualifying revolving retail exposure (QRRE). These criteria must be applied at a sub-portfolio level consistent with the bank’s segmentation of its retail activities generally. Segmentation at the national or country level (or below) should be the general rule.\n",
      " | (1) | The exposures are revolving, unsecured, and uncommitted (both contractually and in practice). In this context, revolving exposures are defined as those where customers’ outstanding balances are permitted to fluctuate based on their decisions to borrow and repay, up to a limit established by the bank.\n",
      " | (2) | The exposures are to individuals.\n",
      " | (3) | The maximum exposure to a single individual in the sub-portfolio is SAR 400,000 or less.\n",
      " | (4) | Because the asset correlation assumptions for the QRRE risk-weight function are markedly below those for the other retail risk-weight function at low PD values, banks must demonstrate that the use of the QRRE risk-weight function is constrained to portfolios that have exhibited low volatility of loss rates, relative to their average level of loss rates, especially within the low PD bands.\n",
      " | (5) | Data on loss rates for the sub-portfolio must be retained in order to allow analysis of the volatility of loss rates.\n",
      " | (6) | The supervisor must concur that treatment as a qualifying revolving retail exposure is consistent with the underlying risk characteristics of the sub-portfolio.\n",
      "10.23 | The QRRE sub-class is split into exposures to transactors and revolvers. A QRRE transactor is an exposure to an obligor that meets the definition set out in paragraph 7.56 . That is, the exposure is to an obligor in relation to a facility such as credit card or charge card where the balance has been repaid in full at each scheduled repayment date for the previous 12 months, or the exposure is in relation to an overdraft facility if there have been no drawdowns over the previous 12 months. All exposures that are not QRRE transactors are QRRE revolvers, including QRRE exposures with less than 12 months of repayment history.\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "10.25 | Eligible purchased receivables are divided into retail and corporate receivables as defined below.\n",
      "Retail receivables\n",
      "10.26 | Purchased retail receivables, provided the purchasing bank complies with the IRB rules for retail exposures, are eligible for the top-down approach as permitted within the existing standards for retail exposures. The bank must also apply the minimum operational requirements as set in chapters 14 and 16 .\n",
      "Corporate receivables\n",
      "10.27 | In general, for purchased corporate receivables, banks are expected to assess the default risk of individual obligors as specified in paragraphs 11.3 to 11.12 consistent with the treatment of other corporate exposures. However, the topdown approach may be used, provided that the purchasing bank’s programme for corporate receivables complies with both the criteria for eligible receivables and the minimum operational requirements of this approach. The use of the topdown purchased receivables treatment is limited to situations where it would be an undue burden on a bank to be subjected to the minimum requirements for the IRB approach to corporate exposures that would otherwise apply. Primarily, it is intended for receivables that are purchased for inclusion in asset-backed securitization structures, but banks may also use this approach, with the approval of SAMA, for appropriate on-balance sheet exposures that share the same features.\n",
      "10.28 | SAMA may deny the use of the top-down approach for purchased corporate receivables depending on the bank’s compliance with minimum requirements. In particular, to be eligible for the proposed ‘top-down’ treatment, purchased corporate receivables must satisfy the following conditions:\n",
      " | (1) | The receivables are purchased from unrelated, third party sellers, and as such the bank has not originated the receivables either directly or indirectly.\n",
      " | (2) | The receivables must be generated on an arm’s-length basis between the seller and the obligor. (As such, intercompany accounts receivable and receivables subject to contra-accounts between firms that buy and sell to each other are ineligible. 52 )\n",
      " | (3) | The purchasing bank has a claim on all proceeds from the pool of receivables or a pro-rata interest in the proceeds. 53\n",
      " | (4) | SAMA may establish concentration limits above which capital charges must be calculated using the minimum requirements for the bottom-up approach for corporate exposures.\n",
      "10.29 | The existence of full or partial recourse to the seller does not automatically disqualify a bank from adopting this top-down approach, as long as the cash flows from the purchased corporate receivables are the primary protection against default risk as determined by the rules in paragraphs 14.4 to 14.7 for purchased receivables and the bank meets the eligibility criteria and operational requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "10.30 | For each of the asset classes covered under the IRB framework, there are three key elements:\n",
      " | (1) | Risk components: estimates of risk parameters provided by banks, some of which are supervisory estimates.\n",
      " | (2) | Risk-weight functions: the means by which risk components are transformed into risk-weighted assets and therefore capital requirements.\n",
      " | (3) | Minimum requirements: the minimum standards that must be met in order for a bank to use the IRB approach for a given asset class.\n",
      "10.31 | For certain asset classes, there are two broad approaches: a foundation and an advanced approach. Under the foundation approach (F-IRB approach), as a general rule, banks provide their own estimates of PD and rely on supervisory estimates for other risk components. Under the advanced approach (A-IRB approach), banks provide their own estimates of PD, LGD and EAD, and their own calculation of M, subject to meeting minimum standards. For both the foundation and advanced approaches, banks must always use the risk-weight functions provided in this Framework for the purpose of deriving capital requirements. The full suite of approaches is described below.\n",
      "10.32 | For exposures to equities, as defined in paragraph 10.24 , the IRB approaches are not permitted (see paragraph 10.41 ). In addition, the A-IRB approach cannot be used for the following:\n",

      " | (2) | Exposures in the bank asset class in paragraph 10.17 , and other securities firms and financial institutions (including insurance companies and any other financial institutions in the corporate asset class).\n",
      "10.33 | In making the assessment for the revenue threshold in paragraph 10.32, the amounts must be as reported in the audited financial statements of the corporates or, for corporates that are part of consolidated groups, their consolidated groups (according to the accounting standard applicable to the ultimate parent of the consolidated group). The figures must be based on the average amounts calculated over the prior three years, or on the latest amounts updated every three years by the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "10.34 | Under the foundation approach, banks must provide their own estimates of PD associated with each of their borrower grades, but must use supervisory estimates for the other relevant risk components. The other risk components are LGD, EAD and M 54 .\n",

      "The SL categories: PF, OF, CF, IPRE and HVCRE\n",
      "10.37 | Banks that do not meet the requirements for the estimation of PD under the corporate foundation approach for their SL exposures are required to map their internal risk grades to five supervisory categories, each of which is associated with a specific risk weight. This approach is termed the ‘supervisory slotting criteria approach’.\n",
      "10.38 | Banks that meet the requirements for the estimation of PD are able to use the foundation approach to corporate exposures to derive risk weights for all classes of SL exposures except HVCRE. SAMA may consider allowing banks meeting these requirements for HVCRE exposures to use a foundation approach that is similar in all respects to the corporate approach, with the exception of a separate risk-weight function as described in paragraph 11.11 .\n",

For eligible corporate receivables, both a foundation and advanced approach are available subject to certain operational requirements being met. As noted in paragraph 10.27 , for corporate purchased receivables, banks are in general expected to assess the default risk of individual obligors. The bank may use the A-IRB treatment for purchased corporate receivables ( paragraphs 14.6 to 14.7 ) only for exposures to individual corporate obligors that are eligible for the A-IRB approach according to paragraphs 10.32 and 10.33 . Otherwise, the F-IRB treatment for purchased corporate receivables should be used. For eligible retail receivables, as with the retail asset class, only the A-IRB approach is available.\n",

Furthermore, once on IRB, data limitations may mean that banks can meet the standards for the use of own estimates of LGD and EAD for some but not all of their exposures within an asset class at the same time (for example, exposures that are in the same asset class, but are in different business units).\n",

The phased rollout includes: (i) adoption of IRB across the asset class within the same business unit; (ii) adoption of IRB for the asset class across business units in the same banking group; and (iii) move from the foundation approach to the advanced approach for certain risk components where use of the advanced approach is permitted. However, when a bank adopts an IRB approach for an asset class within a particular business unit, it must apply the IRB approach to all exposures within that asset class in that unit.\n",
      "10.46 | If a bank intends to adopt an IRB approach to an asset class, it must produce an implementation plan, specifying to what extent and when it intends to roll out the IRB approaches within the asset class and business units. The plan should be realistic, and must be agreed with the SAMA. It should be driven by the practicality and feasibility of moving to the more advanced approaches, and not motivated by a desire to adopt an approach that minimizes its capital charge. During the roll-out period, SAMA will ensure that no capital relief is granted for intra-group transactions which are designed to reduce a banking group’s aggregate capital charge by transferring credit risk among entities on the standardized approach, foundation and advanced IRB approaches.

      "12.29 | The following sections apply to both on and off-balance sheet positions. All exposures are measured gross of specific provisions or partial write-offs. The EAD on drawn amounts should not be less than the sum of: (i) the amount by which a bank’s regulatory capital would be reduced if the exposure were written-off fully; and (ii) any specific provisions and partial write-offs. When the difference between the instrument’s EAD and the sum of (i) and (ii) is positive, this amount is termed a discount. The calculation of risk-weighted assets is independent of any discounts. Under the limited circumstances described in paragraph 15.4 , discounts may be included in the measurement of total eligible provisions for purposes of the EL-provision calculation set out in chapter 15 .\n",
      "Exposure measurement for on-balance sheet items\n",
      "12.30 | On-balance sheet netting of loans and deposits will be recognized subject to the same conditions as under paragraph 9.67 of the standardized approach. Where currency or maturity mismatched on-balance sheet netting exists, the treatment follows the standardized approach, as set out in paragraphs 9.10 and 9.12 to 9.15\n",
      "Exposure measurement for off-balance sheet items (with the exception of derivatives)\n",
      "12.31 | For off-balance sheet items there are two approaches for the estimation of EAD: a foundation approach and an advanced approach. When only the drawn balances of revolving facilities have been securitized, banks must ensure that they continue to hold required capital against the undrawn balances associated with the securitized exposures.\n",
      "12.32 | In the foundation approach, EAD is calculated as the committed but undrawn amount multiplied by a credit conversion factor (CCF). In the advanced approach, EAD for undrawn commitments may be calculated as the committed but undrawn amount multiplied by a CCF or derived from direct estimates of total facility EAD. In both the foundation approach and advanced approaches, the definition of commitments is the same as in the standardized approach, as set out in paragraph 7.86 .\n",
      "EAD under the foundation approach\n",
      "12.33 | The types of instruments and the CCFs applied to them under the F-IRB approach are the same as those in the standardized approach, as set out in paragraphs 7.86 to 7.93 .\n",
      "12.34 | The amount to which the CCF is applied is the lower of the value of the unused committed credit line, and the value that reflects any possible constraining of the availability of the facility, such as the existence of a ceiling on the potential lending amount which is related to a borrower’s reported cash flow. If the facility is constrained in this way, the bank must have sufficient line monitoring and management procedures to support this contention.\n",
      "12.35 | Where a commitment is obtained on another off-balance sheet exposure, banks under the foundation approach are to apply the lower of the applicable CCFs.\n",
      "EAD under the advanced approach\n",
      "12.36 | Banks which meet the minimum requirements for use of their own estimates of EAD (see paragraphs 16.88 to 16.97 ) will be allowed for exposures for which A-IRB is permitted (see paragraph 10.31 ) to use their own internal estimates of EAD for undrawn revolving commitments 58 to extend credit, purchase assets or issue credit substitutes provided the exposure is not subject to a CCF of 100% in the foundation approach (see paragraph 12.33). Standardized approach CCFs must be used for all other off-balance sheet items (for example, undrawn nonrevolving commitments), and must be used where the minimum requirements for own estimates of EAD are not met. The EAD for each exposure that is not in the sovereign asset class that is used as input into the risk weight formula and the calculation of expected loss is subject to a floor that is the sum of: (i) the on balance sheet amount; and (ii) 50% of the off balance sheet exposure using the applicable CCF in the standardized approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exposures that give rise to counterparty credit risk\n",
      "12.37 | For exposures that give rise to counterparty credit risk according to The Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) Framework (i.e. OTC derivatives, exchange- traded derivatives, long settlement transactions and securities financing transactions (SFTs)), the EAD is to be calculated under the rules set in chapters 3 to 8 of the Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) framework .\n",
      "12.38 | For SFTs, banks may recognize a reduction in the counterparty credit risk requirement arising from the effect of a master netting agreement providing that it satisfy the criteria set out in paragraphs 9.61 and 9.62 of the standardized approach. The bank must calculate E*, which is the exposure to be used for the counterparty credit risk requirement taking account of the risk mitigation of collateral received, using the formula set out in paragraph 9.64 of the standardized approach. In calculating risk-weighted assets and expected loss (EL) amounts for the counterparty credit risk arising from the set of transactions covered by the master netting agreement, E* must be used as the EAD of the counterparty.\n",
      "12.39 | As an alternative to the use of standard haircuts for the calculation of the counterparty credit risk requirement for SFTs set out in paragraph 12.38, banks may be permitted to use a value-at-risk (VaR) models approach to reflect price volatility of the exposures and the financial collateral. This approach can take into account the correlation effects between security positions. This approach applies to single SFTs and SFTs covered by netting agreements on a counter party-by-counterparty basis, both under the condition that the collateral is revalued on a daily basis. This holds for the underlying securities being different and unrelated to securitizations. The master netting agreement must satisfy the criteria set out in paragraphs 9.61 and 9.62 of the standardized approach. The VaR models approach is available to banks that have received supervisory recognition for an internal market risk model according to paragraph 10.2 in The Market Risk Framework . Banks which have not received market risk model recognition can separately apply for supervisory recognition to use their internal VaR models for the calculation of potential price volatility for SFTs, provided the model meets the requirements of paragraph 10.2 in The Market Risk Framework . Although the market risk standards have changed from a 99% VaR to a 97.5% expected shortfall, the VaR models approach to SFTs retains the use of a 99% VaR to calculate the counterparty credit risk for SFTs. The VaR model needs to capture risk sufficient to pass the back testing and profit and loss attribution tests of paragraph 10.4 in The Market Risk Framework . The default risk charge of paragraphs 13.18 to 13.39 in The Market Risk Framework is not required in the VaR model for SFTs.\n",
      "12.40 | The quantitative and qualitative criteria for recognition of internal market risk models for SFTs are in principle the same as in paragraphs 10.5 to 10.16 and 13.1 to 13.12 in The Market Risk Framework . The minimum liquidity horizon or the holding period for SFTs is 5 business days for margined repo-style transactions, rather than the 10 business days in paragraph 13.12 in The Market Risk Framework . For other transactions eligible for the VaR models approach, the 10 business day holding period will be retained. The minimum holding period should be adjusted upwards for market instruments where such a holding period would be inappropriate given the liquidity of the instrument concerned.\n",
      "12.41 | The calculation of the exposure E* for banks using their internal model to calculate their counterparty credit risk requirement will be as follows, where banks will use the previous day's VaR number:\n",
      " | [EQUATION]\n",
      "12.42 | Subject to SAMA’s approval, instead of using the VaR approach, banks may also calculate an effective expected positive exposure for repo-style and other similar SFTs, in accordance with the internal models method set out in the counterparty credit risk standards.\n",
      "12.43 | As in the standardized approach, for transactions where the conditions in paragraph 9.36 are met, and in addition, the counterparty is a core market participant as specified in paragraph 9.37 , banks can apply a zero H. A netting set that contains any transaction that does not meet the requirements in paragraph 9.36 of the standardized approach is not eligible for this treatment.\n",
      "Effective maturity (M)\n",
      "12.44 | Effective maturity (M) will be 2.5 years for exposures to which the bank applies the foundation approach, except for repo-style transactions where the effective maturity is 6 months (i.e. M=0.5). Banks using the foundation and advanced approaches are required to measure M for each facility using the definition provided below.\n",
      "12.45 | Banks using any element of the A-IRB approach are required to measure effective maturity for each facility as defined below.\n",
      "12.46 | Except as noted in paragraph 12.51, the effective maturity (M) is subject to a floor of one year and a cap of 5 years.\n",
      "12.47 | For an instrument subject to a determined cash flow schedule, effective maturity M is defined as follows, where CF t denotes the cash flows (principal, interest payments and fees) contractually payable by the borrower in period t:\n",
      " | [EQUATION]\n",
      "12.48 | If a bank is not in a position to calculate the effective maturity of the contracted payments as noted above, it is allowed to use a more conservative measure of M such as that it equals the maximum remaining time (in years) that the borrower is permitted to take to fully discharge its contractual obligation (principal, interest, and fees) under the terms of loan agreement. Normally, this will correspond to the nominal maturity of the instrument.\n",
      "12.49 | For derivatives subject to a master netting agreement, the effective maturity is defined as the weighted average maturity of the transactions within the netting agreement. Further, the notional amount of each transaction should be used for weighting the maturity.\n",
      "12.50 | For revolving exposures, effective maturity must be determined using the maximum contractual termination date of the facility. Banks must not use the repayment date of the current drawing.\n",
      "12.51 | The one-year floor, set out in paragraph 12.46 above, does not apply to certain short- term exposures, comprising fully or nearly-fully collateralized 59 capital market- driven transactions (i.e. OTC derivatives transactions and margin lending) and repo- style transactions (i.e. repos/reverse repos and securities lending/borrowing) with an original maturity of less than one year, where the documentation contains daily re-margining clauses. For all eligible transactions the documentation must require daily revaluation, and must include provisions that must allow for the prompt liquidation or setoff of the collateral in the event of default or failure to re-margin. The maturity of such transactions must be calculated as the greater of one-day, and the effective maturity (M, consistent with the definition above), except for transactions subject to a master netting agreement, where the floor is determined by the minimum holding period for the transaction type, as required by paragraph 12.54.\n",
      "12.52 | The one-year floor, set out in paragraph 12.46 above, also does not apply to the following exposures:\n",
      " | (1) | Short-term self-liquidating trade transactions. Import and export letters of credit and similar transactions should be accounted for at their actual remaining maturity.\n",
      " | (2) | Issued as well as confirmed letters of credit that are short term (i.e. have a maturity below one year) and self-liquidating.\n",
      "12.53 | In addition to the transactions considered in paragraph 12.51 above, other short term exposures with an original maturity of less than one year that are not part of a bank’s ongoing financing of an obligor may be eligible for exemption from the one-year floor. After a careful review of the particular circumstances, SAMA will define the types of short-term exposures that might be considered eligible for this treatment. The results of these reviews might, for example, include transactions such as:\n",
      " | (1) | Some capital market-driven transactions and repo-style transactions that might not fall within the scope of paragraph 12.51.\n",
      " | (2) | Some trade finance transactions that are not exempted by paragraph 12.52.\n",
      " | (3) | Some exposures arising from settling securities purchases and sales. This could also include overdrafts arising from failed securities settlements provided that such overdrafts do not continue more than a short, fixed number of business days.\n",
      " | (4) | Some exposures arising from cash settlements by wire transfer, including overdrafts arising from failed transfers provided that such overdrafts do not continue more than a short, fixed number of business days.\n",
      " | (5) | Some exposures to banks arising from foreign exchange settlements.\n",
      " | (6) | Some short-term loans and deposits.\n",
      "12.54 | For transactions falling within the scope of paragraph 12.51 subject to a master netting agreement, the effective maturity is defined as the weighted average maturity of the transactions. A floor equal to the minimum holding period for the transaction type set out in paragraph 9.56 of the standardized approach will apply to the average. Where more than one transaction type is contained in the master netting agreement a floor equal to the highest holding period will apply to the average. Further, the notional amount of each transaction should be used for weighting maturity.\n",
      "12.55 | Where there is no explicit definition, the effective maturity (M) assigned to all exposures is set at 2.5 years unless otherwise specified in paragraph 12.44.\n",
      "\n",
      "Treatment of maturity mismatches\n",
      "12.56 | The treatment of maturity mismatches under IRB is identical to that in the standardized approach (see paragraphs 9.10 to 0).\n",
      "Risk components for retail exposures\n",
      "12.57 | Paragraphs 12.57 to 12.67 set out the calculation of the risk components for retail exposures. In the case of an exposure that is guaranteed by a sovereign, the floors that apply to the risk components do not apply to that part of the exposure covered by the sovereign guarantee (i.e. any part of the exposure that is not covered by the guarantee is subject to the relevant floors).\n",
      "Probability of default (PD) and loss given default (LGD)\n",
      "12.58 | For each identified pool of retail exposures, banks are expected to provide an estimate of the PD and LGD associated with the pool, subject to the minimum requirements as set out in chapter 16 . Additionally, the PD for retail exposures is the greater of: (i) the one-year PD associated with the internal borrower grade to which the pool of retail exposures is assigned; and (ii) 0.1% for qualifying revolving retail exposure (QRRE) revolvers (see paragraph 10.22 for the definition of QRRE revolvers) and 0.05% for all other exposures. The LGD for each exposure that is used as input into the risk weight formula and the calculation of expected loss must not be less than the parameter floors indicated in table 18 below:\n",

The LGD floor for residential mortgages is fixed at 5%, irrespective of the level of collateral provided by the property.\n",
      "Recognition of guarantees and credit derivatives\n",
      "12.60 | Banks may reflect the risk-reducing effects of guarantees and credit derivatives, either in support of an individual obligation or a pool of exposures, through an adjustment of either the PD or LGD estimate, subject to the minimum requirements in paragraphs 16.99 to 16.110 . Whether adjustments are done through PD or LGD, they must be done in a consistent manner for a given guarantee or credit derivative type. In case the bank applies the standardized approach to direct exposures to the guarantor it may only recognize the guarantee by applying the standardized approach risk weight to the covered portion of the exposure.\n",
      "12.61 | Consistent with the requirements outlined above for corporate and bank exposures, banks must not include the effect of double default in such adjustments. The adjusted risk weight must not be less than that of a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider. Consistent with the standardized approach, banks may choose not to recognize credit protection if doing so would result in a higher capital requirement.\n",
      "Exposure at default (EAD)\n",
      "12.62 | Both on- and off-balance sheet retail exposures are measured gross of specific provisions or partial write-offs. The EAD on drawn amounts should not be less than the sum of: (i) the amount by which a bank’s regulatory capital would be reduced if the exposure were written-off fully; and (ii) any specific provisions and partial write-offs. When the difference between the instrument’s EAD and the sum of (i) and (ii) is positive, this amount is termed a discount. The calculation of risk-weighted assets is independent of any discounts. Under the limited circumstances described in paragraph 15.4 , discounts may be included in the measurement of total eligible provisions for purposes of the EL-provision calculation set out in chapter 15 .\n",
      "12.63 | On-balance sheet netting of loans and deposits of a bank to or from a retail customer will be permitted subject to the same conditions outlined in paragraphs 9.67 and 9.68 of the standardized approach. The definition of commitment is the same as in the standardized approach, as set out in paragraph 7.86 . Banks must use their own estimates of EAD for undrawn revolving commitments to extend credit, purchase assets or issue credit substitutes provided the exposure is not subject to a CCF of 100% in the standardized approach (see paragraph 7.84 ) and the minimum requirements in paragraphs 16.88 to 16.98 are satisfied. Foundation approach CCFs must be used for all other off-balance sheet items (for example, undrawn non- revolving commitments), and must be used where the minimum requirements for own estimates of EAD are not met.\n",
      "12.64 | Regarding own estimates of EAD, the EAD for each exposure that is used as input into the risk weight formula and the calculation of expected loss is subject to a floor that is the sum of: (i) the on balance sheet amount; and (ii) 50% of the off balance sheet exposure using the applicable CCF in the standardized approach.\n",
      "12.65 | For retail exposures with uncertain future drawdown such as credit cards, banks must take into account their history and/or expectation of additional drawings prior to default in their overall calibration of loss estimates. In particular, where a bank does not reflect conversion factors for undrawn lines in its EAD estimates, it must reflect in its LGD estimates the likelihood of additional drawings prior to default. Conversely, if the bank does not incorporate the possibility of additional drawings in its LGD estimates, it must do so in its EAD estimates.\n",
      "12.66 | When only the drawn balances of revolving retail facilities have been securitized, banks must ensure that they continue to hold required capital against the undrawn balances associated with the securitized exposures using the IRB approach to credit risk for commitments.\n",
      "12.67 | To the extent that foreign exchange and interest rate commitments exist within a bank’s retail portfolio for IRB purposes, banks are not permitted to provide their internal assessments of credit equivalent amounts. Instead, the rules for the standardized approach continue to apply.\n",

      "\n",
      "14.2 | For receivables belonging unambiguously to one asset class, the IRB risk weight for default risk is based on the risk-weight function applicable to that particular exposure type, as long as the bank can meet the qualification standards for this particular risk-weight function. For example, if banks cannot comply with the standards for qualifying revolving retail exposures (defined in paragraph 10.22 ), they should use the risk-weight function for other retail exposures. For hybrid pools containing mixtures of exposure types, if the purchasing bank cannot separate the exposures by type, the risk-weight function producing the highest capital requirements for the exposure types in the receivable pool applies.\n",
      "14.3 | For purchased retail receivables, a bank must meet the risk quantification standards for retail exposures but can utilize external and internal reference data to estimate the probabilities of default (PDs) and losses-given-default (LGDs). The estimates for PD and LGD (or expected loss, EL) must be calculated for the receivables on a stand-alone basis; that is, without regard to any assumption of recourse or guarantees from the seller or other parties.\n",
      "14.4 | For purchased corporate receivables the purchasing bank is expected to apply the existing IRB risk quantification standards for the bottom-up approach. However, for eligible purchased corporate receivables, and subject to supervisory permission, a bank may employ the following top-down procedure for calculating IRB risk weights for default risk:\n",
      " | (1) | The purchasing bank will estimate the pool’s one-year EL for default risk, expressed in percentage of the exposure amount (i.e. the total exposure-at-default, or EAD, amount to the bank by all obligors in the receivables pool). The estimated EL must be calculated for the receivables on a stand-alone basis; that is, without regard to any assumption of recourse or guarantees from the seller or other parties. The treatment of recourse or guarantees covering default risk (and/or dilution risk) is discussed separately below.\n",
      " | (2) | Given the EL estimate for the pool’s default losses, the risk weight for default risk is determined by the risk-weight function for corporate exposures 60 . As described below, the precise calculation of risk weights for default risk depends on the bank’s ability to decompose EL into its PD and LGD components in a reliable manner. Banks can utilize external and internal data to estimate PDs and LGDs. However, the advanced approach will not be available for banks that use the foundation approach for corporate exposures.\n",
      "\n",

      " | (1) | If the purchasing bank is unable to decompose EL into its PD and LGD components in a reliable manner, the risk weight is determined from the corporate risk-weight function using the following specifications:\n",
      " |  | (a) | If the bank can demonstrate that the exposures are exclusively senior claims to corporate borrowers:\n",
      " |  |  | (i) | An LGD of 40% can be used.\n",
      " |  |  | (ii) | PD will be calculated by dividing the EL using this LGD.\n",
      " |  |  | (iii) | EAD will be calculated as the outstanding amount minus the capital charge for dilution prior to credit risk mitigation (K Dilution ).\n",
      " |  |  | (iv) | EAD for a revolving purchase facility is the sum of the current amount of receivables purchased plus 40% of any undrawn purchase commitments minus K Dilution .\n",
      " |  | (b) | If the bank cannot demonstrate that the exposures are exclusively senior claims to corporate borrowers:\n",
      " |  |  | (i) | PD is the bank’s estimate of EL.\n",

      " |  |  | (iii) | EAD is the amount outstanding minus K Dilution .\n",
      " |  |  | (iv) | EAD for a revolving purchase facility is the sum of the current amount of receivables purchased plus 40% of any undrawn purchase commitments minus K Dilution .\n",
      " | (2) | If the purchasing bank is able to estimate PD in a reliable manner, the risk weight is determined from the corporate risk-weight functions according to the specifications for LGD, effective maturity (M) and the treatment of guarantees under the foundation approach as given in paragraphs 12.6 to 12.14 , 12.20 to 12.26 and 12.44 .\n",
      "Advanced IRB treatment\n",
      "14.6 | Under the advanced IRB approach, if the purchasing bank can estimate either the pool’s default-weighted average loss rates given default (as defined in paragraph 16.82 ) or average PD in a reliable manner, the bank may estimate the other parameter based on an estimate of the expected long-run loss rate. The bank may: (i) use an appropriate PD estimate to infer the long-run default- weighted average loss rate given default; or (ii) use a long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default to infer the appropriate PD. In either case, the LGD used for the IRB capital calculation for purchased receivables cannot be less than the long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default and must be consistent with the concepts defined in paragraph 16.82 . The risk weight for the purchased receivables will be determined using the bank’s estimated PD and LGD as inputs to the corporate risk-weight function. Similar to the foundation IRB treatment, EAD will be the amount outstanding minus K Dilution . EAD for a revolving purchase facility will be the sum of the current amount of receivables purchased plus 40% of any undrawn purchase commitments minus K Dilution (thus, banks using the advanced IRB approach will not be permitted to use their internal EAD estimates for undrawn purchase commitments).\n",
      "14.7 | For drawn amounts, M will equal the pool’s exposure-weighted average effective maturity (as defined in paragraphs 12.44 to 12.55 ). This same value of M will also be used for undrawn amounts under a committed purchase facility provided the facility contains effective covenants, early amortization triggers, or other features that protect the purchasing bank against a significant deterioration in the quality of the future receivables it is required to purchase over the facility’s term. Absent such effective protections, the M for undrawn amounts will be calculated as the sum of: (a) the longest-dated potential receivable under the purchase agreement;and (b) the remaining maturity of the purchase facility.\n",
      "\n",
      "14.8 | Dilution refers to the possibility that the receivable amount is reduced through cash or non-cash credits to the receivable’s obligor 61 . For both corporate and retail receivables, unless the bank can demonstrate to its supervisor that the dilution risk for the purchasing bank is immaterial, the treatment of dilution risk must be the following:\n",
      " | (1) | At the level of either the pool as a whole (top-down approach) or the individual receivables making up the pool (bottom-up approach), the purchasing bank will estimate the one-year EL for dilution risk, also expressed in percentage of the receivables amount. Banks can utilize external and internal data to estimate EL. As with the treatments of default risk, this estimate must be computed on a stand-alone basis; that is, under the assumption of no recourse or other support from the seller or third-party guarantors.\n",
      " | (2) | For the purpose of calculating risk weights for dilution risk, the corporate risk-weight function must be used with the following settings:\n",
      " |  | (a) | The PD must be set equal to the estimated EL.\n",
      " |  | (b) | The LGD must be set at 100%.\n",
      " |  | (c) | An appropriate maturity treatment applies when determining the capital requirement for dilution risk. If a bank can demonstrate that the dilution risk is appropriately monitored and managed to be resolved within one year, the supervisor may allow the bank to apply a one-year maturity.\n",
      "14.9 | This treatment will be applied regardless of whether the underlying receivables are corporate or retail exposures, and regardless of whether the risk weights for default risk are computed using the standard IRB treatments or, for corporate receivables, the top-down treatment described above.\n",
      "\n",
      "14.10 | In many cases, the purchase price of receivables will reflect a discount (not to be confused with the discount concept defined in paragraphs 12.29 and 12.62 ) that provides first loss protection for default losses, dilution losses or both. To the extent that a portion of such a purchase price discount may be refunded to the seller based on the performance of the receivables, the purchaser may recognize this refundable amount as first-loss protection and hence treat this exposure under the securitization chapters 18 to 23 , while the seller providing such a refundable purchase price discount must treat the refundable amount as a first-loss position under the securitization chapters. Non-refundable purchase price discounts for receivables do not affect either the EL-provision calculation in chapter 15 or the calculation of risk-weighted assets.\n",
      "14.11 | When collateral or partial guarantees obtained on receivables provide first loss protection (collectively referred to as mitigants in this paragraph), and these mitigants cover default losses, dilution losses, or both, they may also be treated as first loss protection under the securitization chapters (see paragraph 22.10 ). When the same mitigant covers both default and dilution risk, banks using the Securitization Internal Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-IRBA) that are able to calculate an exposure-weighted LGD must do so as defined in paragraph 22.21 .\n",
      "\n",
      "14.12 | Credit risk mitigants will be recognized generally using the same type of framework as set forth in paragraphs 12.21 to 12.28 62 .In particular, a guarantee provided by the seller or a third party will be treated using the existing IRB rules for guarantees, regardless of whether the guarantee covers default risk, dilution risk, or both.\n",
      " | (1) | If the guarantee covers both the pool’s default risk and dilution risk, the bank will substitute the risk weight for an exposure to the guarantor in place of the pool’s total risk weight for default and dilution risk.\n",
      " | (2) | If the guarantee covers only default risk or dilution risk, but not both, the bank will substitute the risk weight for an exposure to the guarantor in place of the pool’s risk weight for the corresponding risk component (default or dilution). The capital requirement for the other component will then be added.\n",
      " | (3) | If a guarantee covers only a portion of the default and/or dilution risk, the uncovered portion of the default and/or dilution risk will be treated as per the existing credit risk mitigation rules for proportional or tranched coverage (i.e. the risk weights of the uncovered risk components will be added to the risk weights of the covered risk components)\n",

For corporate, sovereign, bank, and retail exposures that are in default, banks must use their best estimate of expected loss as defined in paragraph 16.85 for exposures subject to the advanced approach and for exposures subject to the foundation approach banks must use the supervisory LGD. For exposures subject to the supervisory slotting criteria EL is calculated as described in the chapter on the supervisory slotting approach ( paragraphs 13.8 to 13.12 ). Securitization exposures do not contribute to the EL amount, as set out in in paragraph 18.36 .\n",

      "15.4 | Total eligible provisions are defined as the sum of all provisions (e.g. specific provisions, partial write-offs, portfolio-specific general provisions such as country risk provisions or general provisions) that are attributed to exposures treated under the IRB approach. In addition, total eligible provisions may include any discounts on defaulted assets. General and specific provisions set aside against securitization exposures must not be included in total eligible provisions.\n",
      "Portion of exposures subject to the standardized approach for credit risk\n",
      "15.5 | Banks using the standardized approach for a portion of their credit risk exposures (see paragraphs 10.43 to 10.48 ), must determine the portion of general provisions attributed to the standardized or IRB treatment of provisions according to the methods outlined in paragraphs 15.6 and 15.7 below.\n",
      "15.6 | Banks should generally attribute total general provisions on a pro rata basis according to the proportion of credit risk-weighted assets subject to the standardized and IRB approaches. However, when one approach to determining credit risk-weighted assets (i.e. standardized or IRB approach) is used exclusively within an entity, general provisions booked within the entity using the standardized approach may be attributed to the standardized treatment. Similarly, general provisions booked within entities using the IRB approach may be attributed to the total eligible provisions as defined in paragraph 15.4.\n",
      "15.7 | At SAMA’s discretion, banks using both the standardized and IRB approaches may rely on their internal methods for allocating general provisions for recognition in capital under either the standardized or IRB approach, subject to the following conditions. Where the internal allocation method is made available, the national supervisor will establish the standards surrounding their use. Banks will need to obtain prior approval from their SAMA to use an internal allocation method for this purpose.\n",
      "\n",
      "15.8 | As specified in articles 2.2.3 and 4.1.4 – Section A of SAMA Guidance Document Concerning the Implementation of Basel III (Circular No. 341000015689, Date: 19 December 2012) , Banks using the IRB approach must compare the total amount of total eligible provisions (as defined in paragraph 15.4 ) with the total EL amount as calculated within the IRB approach (as defined in paragraph 15.2 ). In addition, article 2.2.3 in the aforementioned rules outlines the treatment for that portion of a bank that is subject to the standardized approach for credit risk when the bank uses both the standardized and IRB approaches.\n",
      "15.9 | Where the calculated EL amount is lower than the total eligible provisions of the bank, SAMA will consider whether the EL fully reflects the conditions in the market in which it operates before allowing the difference to be included in Tier 2 capital.

      "\n",
      "16.3 | To be eligible for the IRB approach a bank must demonstrate to SAMA that it meets certain minimum requirements at the outset and on an ongoing basis. Many of these requirements are in the form of objectives that a qualifying bank’s risk rating systems must fulfil. The focus is on banks’ abilities to rank order and quantify risk in a consistent, reliable and valid fashion.\n",
      "16.4 | The overarching principle behind these requirements is that rating and risk estimation systems and processes provide for a meaningful assessment of borrower and transaction characteristics; a meaningful differentiation of risk; and reasonably accurate and consistent quantitative estimates of risk. Furthermore, the systems and processes must be consistent with internal use of these estimates.\n",
      "16.5 | The minimum requirements set out in this chapter apply to all asset classes unless noted otherwise. The standards related to the process of assigning exposures to borrower or facility grades (and the related oversight, validation, etc.) apply equally to the process of assigning retail exposures to pools of homogenous exposures, unless noted otherwise.\n",
      "16.6 | The minimum requirements set out in this chapter apply to both foundation and advanced approaches unless noted otherwise. Generally, all IRB banks must produce their own estimates of probability of default (PD 63 ) and must adhere to the overall requirements for rating system design, operations, controls, and corporate governance, as well as the requisite requirements for estimation and validation of PD measures. Banks wishing to use their own estimates of LGD and EAD must also meet the incremental minimum requirements for these risk factors included in paragraphs 16.82 to 16.110 .\n",
      "\n",
      "16.7 | To be eligible for an IRB approach, a bank must demonstrate to SAMA that it meets the IRB requirements in this framework, at the outset and on an ongoing basis. Banks’ overall credit risk management practices must also be consistent with the evolving sound practice/guidelines issued by SAMA.\n",
      "16.8 | There may be circumstances when a bank is not in complete compliance with all the minimum requirements. Where this is the case, the bank must produce a plan for a timely return to compliance, and seek approval from its supervisor, or the bank must demonstrate that the effect of such noncompliance is immaterial in terms of the risk posed to the institution. Failure to produce an acceptable plan or satisfactorily implement the plan or to demonstrate immateriality will lead SAMA to reconsider the bank’s eligibility for the IRB approach. Furthermore, for the duration of any noncompliance, SAMA will consider the need for the bank to hold additional capital under the supervisory review process or take other appropriate supervisory action.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.9 | The term “rating system” comprises all of the methods, processes, controls, and data collection and IT systems that support the assessment of credit risk, the assignment of internal risk ratings, and the quantification of default and loss estimates.\n",
      "16.10 | Within each asset class, a bank may utilize multiple rating methodologies /systems. For example, a bank may have customized rating systems for specific industries or market segments (e.g. middle market, and large corporate). If a bank chooses to use multiple systems, the rationale for assigning a borrower to a rating system must be documented and applied in a manner that best reflects the level of risk of the borrower. Banks must not allocate borrowers across rating systems inappropriately to minimize regulatory capital requirements (i.e. cherry- picking by choice of rating system). Banks must demonstrate that each system used for IRB purposes is in compliance with the minimum requirements at the outset and on an ongoing basis.\n",
      "Rating dimensions: standards for corporate, sovereign and bank exposures\n",
      "16.11 | A qualifying IRB rating system must have two separate and distinct dimensions:\n",
      " | (1) | the risk of borrower default; and\n",
      " | (2) | transaction-specific factors.\n",
      "16.12 | The first dimension must be oriented to the risk of borrower default. Separate exposures to the same borrower must be assigned to the same borrower grade, irrespective of any differences in the nature of each specific transaction. There are two exceptions to this. Firstly, in the case of country transfer risk, where a bank may assign different borrower grades depending on whether the facility is denominated in local or foreign currency. Secondly, when the treatment of associated guarantees to a facility may be reflected in an adjusted borrower grade. In either case, separate exposures may result in multiple grades for the same borrower. A bank must articulate in its credit policy the relationship between borrower grades in terms of the level of risk each grade implies. Perceived and measured risk must increase as credit quality declines from one grade to the next. The policy must articulate the risk of each grade in terms of both a description of the probability of default risk typical for borrowers assigned the grade and the criteria used to distinguish that level of credit risk.\n",
      "16.13 | The second dimension must reflect transaction-specific factors, such as collateral, seniority, product type, etc. For exposures subject to the foundation IRB approach, this requirement can be fulfilled by the existence of a facility dimension, which reflects both borrower and transaction-specific factors. For example, a rating dimension that reflects expected loss (EL) by incorporating both borrower strength (PD) and loss severity (LGD) considerations would qualify. Likewise a rating system that exclusively reflects LGD would qualify. Where a rating dimension reflects EL and does not separately quantify LGD, the supervisory estimates of LGD must be used.\n",
      "16.14 | For banks using the advanced approach, facility ratings must reflect exclusively LGD. These ratings can reflect any and all factors that can influence LGD including, but not limited to, the type of collateral, product, industry, and purpose. Borrower characteristics may be included as LGD rating criteria only to the extent they are predictive of LGD. Banks may alter the factors that influence facility grades across segments of the portfolio as long as they can satisfy their supervisor that it improves the relevance and precision of their estimates.\n",
      "16.15 | Banks using the supervisory slotting criteria are exempt from this two dimensional requirement for these exposures. Given the interdependence between borrower/transaction characteristics in exposures subject to the supervisory slotting approaches, banks may satisfy the requirements under this heading through a single rating dimension that reflects EL by incorporating both borrower strength (PD) and loss severity (LGD) considerations. This exemption does not apply to banks using the general corporate foundation or advanced approach for the specialized lending (SL) sub-class.\n",
      "Rating dimensions: standards for retail exposures\n",
      "16.16 | Rating systems for retail exposures must be oriented to both borrower and transaction risk, and must capture all relevant borrower and transaction characteristics. Banks must assign each exposure that falls within the definition of retail for IRB purposes into a particular pool. Banks must demonstrate that this process provides for a meaningful differentiation of risk, provides for a grouping of sufficiently homogenous exposures, and allows for accurate and consistent estimation of loss characteristics at pool level.\n",
      "16.17 | For each pool, banks must estimate PD, LGD, and EAD. Multiple pools may share identical PD, LGD and EAD estimates. At a minimum, banks should consider the following risk drivers when assigning exposures to a pool:\n",
      " | (1) | Borrower risk characteristics (e.g. borrower type, demographics such as age /occupation).\n",
      " | (2) | Transaction risk characteristics, including product and/or collateral types (e.g. loan to value measures, seasoning 64 , guarantees; and seniority (first vs. second lien)). Banks must explicitly address cross collateral provisions where present.\n",

      "\n",
      "Rating structure: standards for corporate, sovereign and bank exposures\n",
      "16.18 | A bank must have a meaningful distribution of exposures across grades with no excessive concentrations, on both its borrower-rating and its facility-rating scales.\n",
      "16.19 | To meet this objective, a bank must have a minimum of seven borrower grades for non-defaulted borrowers and one for those that have defaulted. Banks with lending activities focused on a particular market segment may satisfy this requirement with the minimum number of grades.\n",
      "16.20 | A borrower grade is defined as an assessment of borrower risk on the basis of a specified and distinct set of rating criteria, from which estimates of PD are derived. The grade definition must include both a description of the degree of default risk typical for borrowers assigned the grade and the criteria used to distinguish that level of credit risk. Furthermore, “+” or “-” modifiers to alpha or numeric grades will only qualify as distinct grades if the bank has developed complete rating descriptions and criteria for their assignment, and separately quantifies PDs for these modified grades.\n",
      "16.21 | Banks with loan portfolios concentrated in a particular market segment and range of default risk must have enough grades within that range to avoid undue concentrations of borrowers in particular grades. Significant concentrations within a single grade or grades must be supported by convincing empirical evidence that the grade or grades cover reasonably narrow PD bands and that the default risk posed by all borrowers in a grade fall within that band.\n",
      "16.22 | There is no specific minimum number of facility grades for banks using the advanced approach for estimating LGD. A bank must have a sufficient number of facility grades to avoid grouping facilities with widely varying LGDs into a single grade. The criteria used to define facility grades must be grounded in empirical evidence.\n",
      "16.23 | Banks using the supervisory slotting criteria must have at least four grades for non-defaulted borrowers, and one for defaulted borrowers. The requirements for SL exposures that qualify for the corporate foundation and advanced approaches are the same as those for general corporate exposures.\n",
      "Rating structure: standards for retail exposures\n",
      "16.24 | For each pool identified, the bank must be able to provide quantitative measures of loss characteristics (PD, LGD, and EAD) for that pool. The level of differentiation for IRB purposes must ensure that the number of exposures in a given pool is sufficient so as to allow for meaningful quantification and validation of the loss characteristics at the pool level. There must be a meaningful distribution of borrowers and exposures across pools. A single pool must not include an undue concentration of the bank’s total retail exposure.\n",
      "Rating criteria\n",
      "16.25 | A bank must have specific rating definitions, processes and criteria for assigning exposures to grades within a rating system. The rating definitions and criteria must be both plausible and intuitive and must result in a meaningful differentiation of risk.\n",
      " | (1) | The grade descriptions and criteria must be sufficiently detailed to allow those charged with assigning ratings to consistently assign the same grade to borrowers or facilities posing similar risk. This consistency should exist across lines of business, departments and geographic locations. If rating criteria and procedures differ for different types of borrowers or facilities, the bank must monitor for possible inconsistency, and must alter rating criteria to improve consistency when appropriate.\n",
      " | (2) | Written rating definitions must be clear and detailed enough to allow third parties to understand the assignment of ratings, such as internal audit or an equally independent function and supervisors, to replicate rating assignments and evaluate the appropriateness of the grade/pool assignments.\n",
      " | (3) | The criteria must also be consistent with the bank’s internal lending standards and its policies for handling troubled borrowers and facilities.\n",
      "16.26 | To ensure that banks are consistently taking into account available information, they must use all relevant and material information in assigning ratings to borrowers and facilities. Information must be current. The less information a bank has, the more conservative must be its assignments of exposures to borrower and facility grades or pools. An external rating can be the primary factor determining an internal rating assignment; however, the bank must ensure that it considers other relevant information.\n",
      "Rating criteria: exposures subject to the supervisory slotting approach\n",
      "16.27 | Banks using the supervisory slotting criteria must assign exposures to their internal rating grades based on their own criteria, systems and processes, subject to compliance with the requisite minimum requirements. Banks must then map these internal rating grades into the five supervisory rating categories. The slotting criteria tables in the supervisory slotting approach chapter 13 provide, for each sub-class of SL exposures, the general assessment factors and characteristics exhibited by the exposures that fall under each of the supervisory categories. Each lending activity has a unique table describing the assessment factors and characteristics.\n",
      "16.28 | The criteria that banks use to assign exposures to internal grades will not perfectly align with criteria that define the supervisory categories; however, banks must demonstrate that their mapping process has resulted in an alignment of grades which is consistent with the preponderance of the characteristics in the respective supervisory category. Banks should take special care to ensure that any over rides of their internal criteria do not render the mapping process ineffective.\n",
      "Rating assignment horizon\n",
      "16.29 | Although the time horizon used in PD estimation is one year (as described in paragraph 16.62 ), banks are expected to use a longer time horizon in assigning ratings.\n",
      "16.30 | A borrower rating must represent the bank’s assessment of the borrower’s ability and willingness to contractually perform despite adverse economic conditions or the occurrence of unexpected events. The range of economic conditions that are considered when making assessments must be consistent with current conditions and those that are likely to occur over a business cycle within the respective industry/geographic region. Rating systems should be designed in such a way that idiosyncratic or industry-specific changes are a driver of migrations from one category to another, and business cycle effects may also be a driver.\n",
      "16.31 | PD estimates for borrowers that are highly leveraged or for borrowers whose assets are predominantly traded assets must reflect the performance of the underlying assets based on periods of stressed volatilities.\n",
      "16.32 | Given the difficulties in forecasting future events and the influence they will have on a particular borrower’s financial condition, a bank must take a conservative view of projected information. Furthermore, where limited data are available, a bank must adopt a conservative bias to its analysis.\n",
      "Use of models\n",
      "16.33 | The requirements in this section apply to statistical models and other mechanical methods used to assign borrower or facility ratings or in estimation of PDs, LGDs, or EADs. Credit scoring models and other mechanical rating procedures generally use only a subset of available information. Although mechanical rating procedures may sometimes avoid some of the idiosyncratic errors made by rating systems in which human judgement plays a large role, mechanical use of limited information also is a source of rating errors. Credit scoring models and other mechanical procedures are permissible as the primary or partial basis of rating assignments, and may play a role in the estimation of loss characteristics. Sufficient human judgement and human oversight is necessary to ensure that all relevant and material information, including that which is outside the scope of the model, is also taken into consideration, and that the model is used appropriately.\n",
      " | (1) | The burden is on the bank to satisfy its supervisor that a model or procedure has good predictive power and that regulatory capital requirements will not be distorted as a result of its use. The variables that are input to the model must form a reasonable set of predictors. The model must be accurate on average across the range of borrowers or facilities to which the bank is exposed and there must be no known material biases.\n",
      " | (2) | The bank must have in place a process for vetting data inputs into a statistical default or loss prediction model which includes an assessment of the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of the data specific to the assignment of an approved rating.\n",
      " | (3) | The bank must demonstrate that the data used to build the model are representative of the population of the bank’s actual borrowers or facilities.\n",
      " | (4) | When combining model results with human judgement, the judgement must take into account all relevant and material information not considered by the model. The bank must have written guidance describing how human judgement and model results are to be combined.\n",
      " | (5) | The bank must have procedures for human review of model-based rating assignments. Such procedures should focus on finding and limiting errors associated with known model weaknesses and must also include credible ongoing efforts to improve the model’s performance.\n",
      " | (6) | The bank must have a regular cycle of model validation that includes monitoring of model performance and stability; review of model relationships; and testing of model outputs against outcomes.\n",
      "Documentation of rating system design\n",
      "16.34 | Banks must document in writing their rating systems’ design and operational details. The documentation must evidence banks’ compliance with the minimum standards, and must address topics such as portfolio differentiation, rating criteria, responsibilities of parties that rate borrowers and facilities, definition of what constitutes a rating exception, parties that have authority to approve exceptions, frequency of rating reviews, and management oversight of the rating process. A bank must document the rationale for its choice of internal rating criteria and must be able to provide analyses demonstrating that rating criteria and procedures are likely to result in ratings that meaningfully differentiate risk. Rating criteria and procedures must be periodically reviewed to determine whether they remain fully applicable to the current portfolio and to external conditions. In addition, a bank must document a history of major changes in the risk rating process, and such documentation must support identification of changes made to the risk rating process subsequent to the last supervisory review. The organization of rating assignment, including the internal control structure, must also be documented.\n",
      "16.35 | Banks must document the specific definitions of default and loss used internally and demonstrate consistency with the reference definitions set out in paragraphs 16.67 to 16.75 .\n",
      "16.36 | If the bank employs statistical models in the rating process, the bank must document their methodologies. This material must:\n",
      " | (1) | Provide a detailed outline of the theory, assumptions and/or mathematical and empirical basis of the assignment of estimates to grades, individual obligors, exposures, or pools, and the data source(s) used to estimate the model;\n",
      " | (2) | Establish a rigorous statistical process (including out-of-time and out- of-sample performance tests) for validating the model; and\n",
      " | (3) | Indicate any circumstances under which the model does not work effectively.\n",
      "16.37 | Use of a model obtained from a third-party vendor that claims proprietary technology is not a justification for exemption from documentation or any other of the requirements for internal rating systems. The burden is on the model’s vendor and the bank to satisfy SAMA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coverage of ratings\n",
      "16.38 | For corporate, sovereign and bank exposures, each borrower and all recognized guarantors must be assigned a rating and each exposure must be associated with a facility rating as part of the loan approval process. Similarly, for retail, each exposure must be assigned to a pool as part of the loan approval process.\n",
      "16.39 | Each separate legal entity to which the bank is exposed must be separately rated. A bank must have policies acceptable to its supervisor regarding the treatment of individual entities in a connected group including circumstances under which the same rating may or may not be assigned to some or all related entities. Those policies must include a process for the identification of specific wrong way risk for each legal entity to which the bank is exposed. Transactions with counterparties where specific wrong way risk has been identified need to be treated differently when calculating the EAD for such exposures (see paragraph 7.48 in the CCR framework ).\n",
      "Integrity of rating process: standards for corporate, sovereign and bank exposures\n",
      "16.40 | Rating assignments and periodic rating reviews must be completed or approved by a party that does not directly stand to benefit from the extension of credit. Independence of the rating assignment process can be achieved through a range of practices that will be carefully reviewed by SAMA. These operational processes must be documented in the bank’s procedures and incorporated into bank policies. Credit policies and underwriting procedures must reinforce and foster the independence of the rating process.\n",
      "16.41 | Borrowers and facilities must have their ratings refreshed at least on an annual basis. Certain credits, especially higher risk borrowers or problem exposures, must be subject to more frequent review. In addition, banks must initiate a new rating if material information on the borrower or facility comes to light.\n",
      "16.42 | The bank must have an effective process to obtain and update relevant and material information on the borrower’s financial condition, and on facility characteristics that affect LGDs and EADs (such as the condition of collateral). Upon receipt, the bank needs to have a procedure to update the borrower’s rating in a timely fashion.\n",
      "Integrity of rating process: standards for retail exposures\n",
      "16.43 | A bank must review the loss characteristics and delinquency status of each identified risk pool on at least an annual basis. It must also review the status of individual borrowers within each pool as a means of ensuring that exposures continue to be assigned to the correct pool. This requirement may be satisfied by review of a representative sample of exposures in the pool.\n",
      "Overrides\n",
      "16.44 | For rating assignments based on expert judgement, banks must clearly articulate the situations in which bank officers may override the outputs of the rating process, including how and to what extent such overrides can be used and by whom. For model-based ratings, the bank must have guidelines and processes for monitoring cases where human judgement has overridden the model’s rating, variables were excluded or inputs were altered. These guidelines must include identifying personnel that are responsible for approving these overrides. Banks must identify overrides and separately track their performance.\n",
      "Data maintenance\n",
      "16.45 | A bank must collect and store data on key borrower and facility characteristics to provide effective support to its internal credit risk measurement and management process, to enable the bank to meet the other requirements in this document, and to serve as a basis for supervisory reporting. These data should be sufficiently detailed to allow retrospective re-allocation of obligors and facilities to grades, for example if increasing sophistication of the internal rating system suggests that finer segregation of portfolios can be achieved. Furthermore, banks must collect and retain data on aspects of their internal ratings as required by Pillar 3 Disclosure Requirements Framework .\n",
      "Data maintenance: for corporate, sovereign and bank exposures\n",
      "16.46 | Banks must maintain rating histories on borrowers and recognized guarantors, including the rating since the borrower/guarantor was assigned an internal grade, the dates the ratings were assigned, the methodology and key data used to derive the rating and the person/model responsible. The identity of borrowers and facilities that default, and the timing and circumstances of such defaults, must be retained. Banks must also retain data on the PDs and realized default rates associated with rating grades and ratings migration in order to track the predictive power of the borrower rating system.\n",
      "16.47 | Banks using the advanced IRB approach must also collect and store a complete history of data on the LGD and EAD estimates associated with each facility and the key data used to derive the estimate and the person/model responsible. Banks must also collect data on the estimated and realized LGDs and EADs associated with each defaulted facility. Banks that reflect the credit risk mitigating effects of guarantees/credit derivatives through LGD must retain data on the LGD of the facility before and after evaluation of the effects of the guarantee/credit derivative. Information about the components of loss or recovery for each defaulted exposure must be retained, such as amounts recovered, source of recovery (e.g. collateral, liquidation proceeds and guarantees), time period required for recovery, and administrative costs.\n",
      "16.48 | Banks under the foundation approach which utilize supervisory estimates are encouraged to retain the relevant data (i.e. data on loss and recovery experience for corporate exposures under the foundation approach, data on realized losses for banks using the supervisory slotting criteria).\n",
      "Data maintenance: for retail exposures\n",
      "16.49 | Banks must retain data used in the process of allocating exposures to pools, including data on borrower and transaction risk characteristics used either directly or through use of a model, as well as data on delinquency. Banks must also retain data on the estimated PDs, LGDs and EADs, associated with pools of exposures. For defaulted exposures, banks must retain the data on the pools to which the exposure was assigned over the year prior to default and the realized outcomes on LGD and EAD.\n",
      "Stress tests used in assessment of capital adequacy\n",
      "16.50 | An IRB bank must have in place sound stress testing processes for use in the assessment of capital adequacy. Stress testing must involve identifying possible events or future changes in economic conditions that could have unfavorable effects on a bank’s credit exposures and assessment of the bank’s ability to withstand such changes. Examples of scenarios that could be used are:\n",
      " | (1) | Economic or industry downturns;\n",
      " | (2) | Market-risk events; and\n",
      " | (3) | Liquidity conditions.\n",
      "16.51 | In addition to the more general tests described above, the bank must perform a credit risk stress test to assess the effect of certain specific conditions on its IRB regulatory capital requirements. The test to be employed would be one chosen by the bank, subject to supervisory review. The test to be employed must be meaningful and reasonably conservative. Individual banks may develop different approaches to undertaking this stress test requirement, depending on their circumstances. For this purpose, the objective is not to require banks to consider worst-case scenarios. The bank’s stress test in this context should, however, consider at least the effect of mild recession scenarios. In this case, one example might be to use two consecutive quarters of zero growth to assess the effect on the bank’s PDs, LGDs and EADs, taking account – on a conservative basis- of the bank’s international diversification.\n",
      "16.52 | Whatever method is used, the bank must include a consideration of the following sources of information. First, a bank’s own data should allow estimation of the ratings migration of at least some of its exposures. Second, banks should consider information about the impact of smaller deterioration in the credit environment on a bank’s ratings, giving some information on the likely effect of bigger, stress circumstances. Third, banks should evaluate evidence of ratings migration in external ratings. This would include the bank broadly matching its buckets to rating categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Corporate governance\n",
      "16.53 | All material aspects of the rating and estimation processes must be approved by the bank’s board of directors or a designated authority. These parties must possess a general understanding of the bank’s risk rating system and detailed comprehension of its associated management reports. Senior management must provide notice to the board of directors or a designated committee thereof of material changes or exceptions from established policies that will materially impact the operations of the bank’s rating system.\n",
      "16.54 | Senior management also must have a good understanding of the rating system’s design and operation, and must approve material differences between established procedure and actual practice. Management must also ensure, on an ongoing basis, that the rating system is operating properly. Management and staff in the credit control function must meet regularly to discuss the performance of the rating process, areas needing improvement, and the status of efforts to improve previously identified deficiencies.\n",
      "16.55 | Internal ratings must be an essential part of the reporting to these parties. Reporting must include risk profile by grade, migration across grades, estimation of the relevant parameters per grade, and comparison of realized default rates (and LGDs and EADs for banks on advanced approaches) against expectations. Reporting frequencies may vary with the significance and type of information and the level of the recipient.\n",
      "Credit risk control\n",
      "16.56 | Banks must have independent credit risk control units that are responsible for the design or selection, implementation and performance of their internal rating systems. The unit(s) must be functionally independent from the personnel and management functions responsible for originating exposures. Areas of responsibility must include:\n",
      " | (1) | Testing and monitoring internal grades;\n",
      " | (2) | Production and analysis of summary reports from the bank’s rating system, to include historical default data sorted by rating at the time of default and one year prior to default, grade migration analyses, and monitoring of trends in key rating criteria;\n",
      " | (3) | Implementing procedures to verify that rating definitions are consistently applied across departments and geographic areas;\n",
      " | (4) | Reviewing and documenting any changes to the rating process, including the reasons for the changes; and\n",
      " | (5) | Reviewing the rating criteria to evaluate if they remain predictive of risk. Changes to the rating process, criteria or individual rating parameters must be documented and retained for SAMA to review.\n",
      "16.57 | A credit risk control unit must actively participate in the development, selection, implementation and validation of rating models. It must assume oversight and supervision responsibilities for any models used in the rating process, and ultimate responsibility for the ongoing review and alterations to rating models.\n",
      "Internal and external audit\n",
      "16.58 | Internal audit or an equally independent function must review at least annually, the bank’s rating system and its operations, including the operations of the creditfunction and the estimation of PDs, LGDs and EADs. Areas of review include adherence to all applicable minimum requirements. Internal audit must document its findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.59 | Internal ratings and default and loss estimates must play an essential role in the credit approval, risk management, internal capital allocations, and corporate governance functions of banks using the IRB approach. Ratings systems and estimates designed and implemented exclusively for the purpose of qualifying for the IRB approach and used only to provide IRB inputs are not acceptable. It is recognized that banks will not necessarily be using exactly the same estimates for both IRB and all internal purposes. For example, pricing models are likely to use PDs and LGDs relevant to the life of the asset. Where there are such differences, a bank must document them and demonstrate their reasonableness to SAMA.\n",
      "16.60 | A bank must have a credible track record in the use of internal ratings information. Thus, the bank must demonstrate that it has been using a rating system that was broadly in line with the minimum requirements articulated in this document for at least the three years prior to qualification. A bank using the advanced IRB approach must demonstrate that it has been estimating and employing LGDs and EADs in a manner that is broadly consistent with the minimum requirements for use of own estimates of LGDs and EADs for at least the three years prior to qualification. Improvements to a bank’s rating system will not render a bank non-compliant with the three-year requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall requirements for estimation (structure and intent)\n",
      "16.61 | This section addresses the broad standards for own-estimates of PD, LGD, and EAD. Generally, all banks using the IRB approaches must estimate a PD 65 for each internal borrower grade for corporate, sovereign and bank exposures or for each pool in the case of retail exposures.\n",
      "16.62 | PD estimates must be a long-run average of one-year default rates for borrowers in the grade, with the exception of retail exposures as set out in paragraphs 16.80 and 16.81. Requirements specific to PD estimation are provided in paragraphs 16.76 to 16.81. Banks on the advanced approach must estimate an appropriate LGD (as defined in paragraphs 16.82 to 16.87) for each of its facilities (or retail pools). For exposures subject to the advanced approach, banks must also estimate an appropriate long-run default-weighted average EAD for each of its facilities as defined in paragraphs 16.88 and 16.89. Requirements specific to EAD estimation appear in paragraphs 16.88 to 16.98. For corporate, sovereign and bank exposures, banks that do not meet the requirements for own-estimates of EAD or LGD, above, must use the supervisory estimates of these parameters. Standards for use of such estimates are set out in paragraphs 16.127 to 16.144 .\n",
      "16.63 | Internal estimates of PD, LGD, and EAD must incorporate all relevant, material and available data, information and methods. A bank may utilize internal data and data from external sources (including pooled data). Where internal or external data is used, the bank must demonstrate that its estimates are representative of long run experience.\n",
      "16.64 | Estimates must be grounded in historical experience and empirical evidence, and not based purely on subjective or judgmental considerations. Any changes in lending practice or the process for pursuing recoveries over the observation period must be taken into account. A bank’s estimates must promptly reflect the implications of technical advances and new data and other information, as it becomes available. Banks must review their estimates on a yearly basis or more frequently.\n",
      "16.65 | The population of exposures represented in the data used for estimation, and lending standards in use when the data were generated, and other relevant characteristics should be closely matched to or at least comparable with those of the bank’s exposures and standards. The bank must also demonstrate that economic or market conditions that underlie the data are relevant to current and foreseeable conditions. For estimates of LGD and EAD, banks must take into account paragraphs 16.82 to 16.98. The number of exposures in the sample and the data period used for quantification must be sufficient to provide the bank with confidence in the accuracy and robustness of its estimates. The estimation technique must perform well in out-of-sample tests.\n",
      "16.66 | In general, estimates of PDs, LGDs, and EADs are likely to involve unpredictable errors. In order to avoid over-optimism, a bank must add to its estimates a margin of conservatism that is related to the likely range of errors. Where methods and data are less satisfactory and the likely range of errors is larger, the margin of conservatism must be larger. SAMA may, on case by case basis, allow some flexibility in application of the required standards for data that are collected prior to the date of implementation of this Framework. However, in such cases banks must demonstrate that appropriate adjustments have been made to achieve broad equivalence to the data without such flexibility. Data collected beyond the date of implementation must conform to the minimum standards unless otherwise stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Definition of default\n",
      "16.67 | A default is considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either or both of the two following events have taken place.\n",
      " | (1) | The bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the banking group in full, without recourse by the bank to actions such as realizing security (if held).\n",
      " | (2) | The obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the banking group. Overdrafts will be considered as being past due once the customer has breached an advised limit or been advised of a limit smaller than current out standings.\n",
      "16.68 | The elements to be taken as indications of unlikeliness to pay include:\n",
      " | (1) | The bank puts the credit obligation on non-accrued status.\n",
      " | (2) | The bank makes a charge-off or account-specific provision resulting from a significant perceived decline in credit quality subsequent to the bank taking on the exposure.\n",
      " | (3) | The bank sells the credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss.\n",
      " | (4) | The bank consents to a distressed restructuring of the credit obligation where this is likely to result in a diminished financial obligation caused by the material forgiveness, or postponement, of principal, interest or (where relevant) fees.\n",
      " | (5) | The bank has filed for the obligor’s bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of the obligor’s credit obligation to the banking group.\n",
      " | (6) | The obligor has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar protection where this would avoid or delay repayment of the credit obligation to the banking group.\n",
      "16.69 | SAMA will provide appropriate guidance as to how these elements must be implemented and monitored.\n",
      "16.70 | For retail exposures, the definition of default can be applied at the level of a particular facility, rather than at the level of the obligor. As such, default by a borrower on one obligation does not require a bank to treat all other obligations to the banking group as defaulted.\n",
      "16.71 | A bank must record actual defaults on IRB exposure classes using this reference definition. A bank must also use the reference definition for its estimation of PDs, and (where relevant) LGDs and EADs. In arriving at these estimations, a bank may use external data available to it that is not itself consistent with that definition, subject to the requirements set out in paragraph 16.77. However, in such cases, banks must demonstrate to SAMA that appropriate adjustments to the data have been made to achieve broad equivalence with the reference definition. This same condition would apply to any internal data used up to implementation of this Framework. Internal data (including that pooled by banks) used in such estimates beyond the date of implementation of this Framework must be consistent with the reference definition.\n",
      "16.72 | If the bank considers that a previously defaulted exposure’s status is such that no trigger of the reference definition any longer applies, the bank must rate the borrower and estimate LGD as they would for a non-defaulted facility. Should the reference definition subsequently be triggered, a second default would be deemed to have occurred.\n",
      "Re-ageing\n",
      "16.73 | The bank must have clearly articulated and documented policies in respect of the counting of days past due, in particular in respect of the re-ageing of the facilities and the granting of extensions, deferrals, renewals and rewrites to existing accounts. At a minimum, the re-ageing policy must include: (a) approval authorities and reporting requirements; (b) minimum age of a facility before it is eligible for re-ageing; (c) delinquency levels of facilities that are eligible for re- ageing; (d) maximum number of re-ageings per facility; and (e) a reassessment of the borrower’s capacity to repay. These policies must be applied consistently over time, and must support the ‘use test’ (ie if a bank treats a re-aged exposure in a similar fashion to other delinquent exposures more than the past-due cut off point, this exposure must be recorded as in default for IRB purposes).\n",
      "Treatment of overdrafts\n",
      "16.74 | Authorized overdrafts must be subject to a credit limit set by the bank and brought to the knowledge of the client. Any break of this limit must be monitored; if the account were not brought under the limit after 90 to 180 days (subject to the applicable past-due trigger), it would be considered as defaulted. Non-authorized overdrafts will be associated with a zero limit for IRB purposes. Thus, days past due commence once any credit is granted to an unauthorized customer; if such credit were not repaid within 90 to 180 days, the exposure would be considered in default. Banks must have in place rigorous internal policies for assessing the creditworthiness of customers who are offered overdraft accounts.\n",
      "Definition of loss for all asset classes\n",
      "16.75 | The definition of loss used in estimating LGD is economic loss. When measuring economic loss, all relevant factors should be taken into account. This must include material discount effects and material direct and indirect costs associated with collecting on the exposure. Banks must not simply measure the loss recorded in accounting records, although they must be able to compare accounting and economic losses. The bank’s own workout and collection expertise significantly influences their recovery rates and must be reflected in their LGD estimates, but adjustments to estimates for such expertise must be conservative until the bank has sufficient internal empirical evidence of the impact of its expertise.\n",
      "Requirements specific to PD estimation: corporate, sovereign and bank exposures\n",
      "16.76 | Banks must use information and techniques that take appropriate account of the long-run experience when estimating the average PD for each rating grade. For example, banks may use one or more of the three specific techniques set out below: internal default experience, mapping to external data, and statistical default models.\n",
      "16.77 | Banks may have a primary technique and use others as a point of comparison and potential adjustment. SAMA will not be satisfied by mechanical application of a technique without supporting analysis. Banks must recognize the importance of judgmental considerations in combining results of techniques and in making adjustments for limitations of techniques and information. For all methods listed below, banks must estimate a PD for each rating grade based on the observed historical average one-year default rate that is a simple average based on number of obligors (count weighted). Weighting approaches, such as EAD weighting, are not permitted.\n",
      " | (1) | A bank may use data on internal default experience for the estimation of PD. A bank must demonstrate in its analysis that the estimates are reflective of underwriting standards and of any differences in the rating system that generated the data and the current rating system. Where only limited data are available, or where underwriting standards or rating systems have changed, the bank must add a greater margin of conservatism in its estimate of PD. The use of pooled data across institutions may also be recognized. A bank must demonstrate that the internal rating systems and criteria of other banks in the pool are comparable with its own.\n",
      " | (2) | Banks may associate or map their internal grades to the scale used by an external credit assessment institution or similar institution and then attribute the default rate observed for the external institution’s grades to the bank’s grades. Mappings must be based on a comparison of internal rating criteria to the criteria used by the external institution and on a comparison of the internal and external ratings of any common borrowers. Biases or inconsistencies in the mapping approach or underlying data must be avoided. The external institution’s criteria underlying the data used for quantification must be oriented to the risk of the borrower and not reflect transaction characteristics. The bank’s analysis must include a comparison of the default definitions used, subject to the requirements in paragraphs 16.67 to 16.72. The bank must document the basis for the mapping.\n",
      " | (3) | A bank is allowed to use a simple average of default-probability estimates for individual borrowers in a given grade, where such estimates are drawn from statistical default prediction models. The bank’s use of default probability models for this purpose must meet the standards specified in paragraph 16.33 .\n",
      "16.78 | Irrespective of whether a bank is using external, internal, or pooled data sources, or a combination of the three, for its PD estimation, the length of the underlying historical observation period used must be at least five years for at least one source. If the available observation period spans a longer period for any source, and this data are relevant and material, this longer period must be used. The data should include a representative mix of good and bad years.\n",
      "Requirements specific to PD estimation: retail exposures\n",
      "16.79 | Given the bank-specific basis of assigning exposures to pools, banks must regard internal data as the primary source of information for estimating loss characteristics. Banks are permitted to use external data or statistical models for quantification provided a strong link can be demonstrated between: (a) the bank’s process of assigning exposures to a pool and the process used by the external data source; and (b) between the bank’s internal risk profile and the composition of the external data. In all cases banks must use all relevant and material data sources as points of comparison.\n",
      "16.80 | One method for deriving long-run average estimates of PD and default- weighted average loss rates given default (as defined in paragraph 16.82) for retail would be based on an estimate of the expected long-run loss rate. A bank may (i) use an appropriate PD estimate to infer the long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default, or (ii) use a long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default to infer the appropriate PD. In either case, it is important to recognize that the LGD used for the IRB capital calculation cannot be less than the long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default and must be consistent with the concepts defined in paragraph 16.82.\n",
      "16.81 | Irrespective of whether banks are using external, internal, pooled data sources, or a combination of the three, for their estimation of loss characteristics, the length of the underlying historical observation period used must be at least five years. If the available observation spans a longer period for any source, and these data are relevant, this longer period must be used. The data should include a representative mix of good and bad years of the economic cycle relevant for the portfolio. The PD should be based on the observed historical average one-year default rate.\n",
      "Requirements specific to own-LGD estimates: standards for all asset classes\n",
      "16.82 | A bank must estimate an LGD for each facility that aims to reflect economic downturn conditions where necessary to capture the relevant risks. This LGD cannot be less than the long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default calculated based on the average economic loss of all observed defaults within the data source for that type of facility. In addition, a bank must take into account the potential for the LGD of the facility to be higher than the default-weighted average during a period when credit losses are substantially higher than average. For certain types of exposures, loss severities may not exhibit such cyclical variability and LGD estimates may not differ materially from the long-run default- weighted average. However, for other exposures, this cyclical variability in loss severities may be important and banks will need to incorporate it into their LGD estimates. For this purpose, banks may make reference to the averages of loss severities observed during periods of high credit losses, forecasts based on appropriately conservative assumptions, or other similar methods. Appropriate estimates of LGD during periods of high credit losses might be formed using either internal and/or external data. SAMA will continue to monitor and encourage the development of appropriate approaches to this issue.\n",
      "16.83 | In its analysis, the bank must consider the extent of any dependence between the risk of the borrower and that of the collateral or collateral provider. Cases where there is a significant degree of dependence must be addressed in a conservative manner. Any currency mismatch between the underlying obligation and the collateral must also be considered and treated conservatively in the bank’s assessment of LGD.\n",
      "16.84 | LGD estimates must be grounded in historical recovery rates and, when applicable, must not solely be based on the collateral’s estimated market value. This requirement recognizes the potential inability of banks to gain both control of their collateral and liquidate it expeditiously. To the extent that LGD estimates take into account the existence of collateral, banks must establish internal requirements for collateral management, operational procedures, legal certainty and risk management process that are generally consistent with those required for the foundation IRB approach.\n",
      "16.85 | Recognizing the principle that realized losses can at times systematically exceed expected levels, the LGD assigned to a defaulted asset should reflect the possibility that the bank would have to recognize additional, unexpected losses during the recovery period. For each defaulted asset, the bank must also construct its best estimate of the expected loss on that asset based on current economic circumstances and facility status. The amount, if any, by which the LGD on a defaulted asset exceeds the bank’s best estimate of expected loss on the asset represents the capital requirement for that asset, and should be set by the bank on a risk-sensitive basis in accordance with paragraph 11.3 .Instances where the best estimate of expected loss on a defaulted asset is less than the sum of specific provisions and partial charge- offs on that asset will attract supervisory scrutiny and must be justified by the bank.\n",

      "Requirements specific to own-EAD estimates: standards for all asset classes\n",
      "16.88 | EAD for an on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet item is defined as the expected gross exposure of the facility upon default of the obligor. For on-balance sheet items, banks must estimate EAD at no less than the current drawn amount, subject to recognizing the effects of on-balance sheet netting as specified in the foundation approach. The minimum requirements for the recognition of netting are the same as those under the foundation approach. The additional minimum requirements for internal estimation of EAD under the advanced approach, therefore, focus on the estimation of EAD for off- balance sheet items (excluding transactions that expose banks to counterparty credit risk as set out in chapter 5 of the Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) framework ). Banks using the advanced approach must have established procedures in place for the estimation of EAD for off-balance sheet items. These must specify the estimates of EAD to be used for each facility type. Banks’ estimates of EAD should reflect the possibility of additional drawings by the borrower up to and after the time a default event is triggered. Where estimates of EAD differ by facility type, the delineation of these facilities must be clear and unambiguous.\n",
      "16.89 | Under the advanced approach, banks must assign an estimate of EAD for each eligible facility. It must be an estimate of the long-run default-weighted average EAD for similar facilities and borrowers over a sufficiently long period of time, but with a margin of conservatism appropriate to the likely range of errors in the estimate. If a positive correlation can reasonably be expected between the default frequency and the magnitude of EAD, the EAD estimate must incorporate a larger margin of conservatism. Moreover, for exposures for which EAD estimates are volatile over the economic cycle, the bank must use EAD estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn, if these are more conservative than the long-run average. For banks that have been able to develop their own EAD models, this could be achieved by considering the cyclical nature, if any, of the drivers of such models. Other banks may have sufficient internal data to examine the impact of previous recession(s). However, some banks may only have the option of making conservative use of external data. Moreover, where a bank bases its estimates on alternative measures of central tendency (such as the median or a higher percentile estimate) or only on ‘downturn’ data, it should explicitly confirm that the basic downturn requirement of the framework is met, ie the bank’s estimates do not fall below a (conservative) estimate of the long-run default- weighted average EAD for similar facilities.\n",
      "16.90 | The criteria by which estimates of EAD are derived must be plausible and intuitive, and represent what the bank believes to be the material drivers of EAD. The choices must be supported by credible internal analysis by the bank. The bank must be able to provide a breakdown of its EAD experience by the factors it sees as the drivers of EAD. A bank must use all relevant and material information in its derivation of EAD estimates. Across facility types, a bank must review its estimates of EAD when material new information comes to light and at least on an annual basis.\n",
      "16.91 | Due consideration must be paid by the bank to its specific policies and strategies adopted in respect of account monitoring and payment processing. The bank must also consider its ability and willingness to prevent further drawings in circumstances short of payment default, such as covenant violations or other technical default events. Banks must also have adequate systems and procedures in place to monitor facility amounts, current outstandings against committed lines and changes in outstandings per borrower and per grade. The bank must be able to monitor outstanding balances on a daily basis.\n",
      "16.92 | Banks’ EAD estimates must be developed using a 12-month fixed-horizon approach; i.e. for each observation in the reference data set, default outcomes must be linked to relevant obligor and facility characteristics twelve months prior to default.\n",
      "16.93 | As set out in paragraph 16.65, banks’ EAD estimates should be based on reference data that reflect the obligor, facility and bank management practice characteristics of the exposures to which the estimates are applied. Consistent with this principle, EAD estimates applied to particular exposures should not be based on data that comingle the effects of disparate characteristics or data from exposures that exhibit different characteristics (e.g. same broad product grouping but different customers that are managed differently by the bank). The estimates should be based on appropriately homogenous segments. Alternatively, the estimates should be based on an estimation approach that effectively disentangles the impact of the different characteristics exhibited within the relevant dataset. Practices that generally do not comply with this principle include use of estimates based or partly based on:\n",
      " | (1) | SME/midmarket data being applied to large corporate obligors.\n",
      " | (2) | Data from commitments with ‘small’ unused limit availability being applied to facilities with ‘large’ unused limit availability.\n",

SAMA expects banks to demonstrate a detailed understanding of the impact of changes in customer product mix on EAD reference data sets (and associated EAD estimates) and that the impact is immaterial or has been effectively mitigated within each bank’s estimation process. Banks’ analyses in this regard will be actively challenged by SAMA. Effective mitigation would not include: setting floors to credit conversion factor (CCF)/EAD observations; use of obligor-level estimates that do not fully cover the relevant product transformation options or inappropriately combine products with very different characteristics (e.g. revolving and non-revolving products); adjusting only ‘material’ observations affected by product transformation; generally excluding observations affected by product profile transformation (thereby potentially distorting the representativeness of the remaining data).\n",
      "16.94 | A well-known feature of the commonly used undrawn limit factor (ULF) approach 66 to estimating CCFs is the region of instability associated with facilities close to being fully drawn at reference date. Banks should ensure that their EAD estimates are effectively quarantined from the potential effects of this region of instability.\n",
      " | (1) | An acceptable approach could include using an estimation method other than the ULF approach that avoids the instability issue by not using potentially small undrawn limits that could approach zero in the denominator or, as appropriate, switching to a method other than the ULF as the region of instability is approached, e.g. a limit factor, balance factor or additional utilization factor approach 67 . Note that, consistent with paragraph 16.93, including limit utilization as a driver in EAD models could quarantine much of the relevant portfolio from this issue but, in the absence of other actions, leaves open how to develop appropriate EAD estimates to be applied to exposures within the region of instability.\n",
      " | (2) | Common but ineffective approaches to mitigating this issue include capping and flooring reference data (e.g. observed CCFs at 100 per cent and zero respectively) or omitting observations that are judged to be affected.\n",

The option to adjust LGDs is available only to those banks that have been approved to use their own internal estimates of LGD. For retail exposures, where guarantees exist, either in support of an individual obligation or a pool of exposures, a bank may reflect the risk-reducing effect either through its estimates of PD or LGD, provided this is done consistently. In adopting one or the other technique, a bank must adopt a consistent approach, both across types of guarantees and over time.\n",

A bank must follow all minimum requirements for assigning borrower ratings set out in this document, including the regular monitoring of the guarantor’s condition and ability and willingness to honour its obligations. Consistent with the requirements in paragraphs 16.46 and 16.47 , a bank must retain all relevant information on the borrower absent the guarantee and the guarantor. In the case of retail guarantees, these requirements also apply to the assignment of an exposure to a pool, and the estimation of PD.\n",

The guarantee must also be unconditional; there should be no clause in the protection contract outside the direct control of the bank that could prevent the protection provider from being obliged to pay out in a timely manner in the event that the original counterparty fails to make the payment(s) due. However, under the advanced IRB approach, guarantees that only cover loss remaining after the bank has first pursued the original obligor for payment and has completed the workout process may be recognized.\n",

Collateral interests must reflect a perfected lien (i.e. all legal requirements for establishing the claim have been fulfilled). Furthermore, the collateral agreement and the legal process underpinning it must be such that they provide for the bank to realize the value of the collateral within a reasonable timeframe.\n",

      " | (3) | Frequent revaluation: the bank is expected to monitor the value of the collateral on a frequent basis and at a minimum once every year. More frequent monitoring is suggested where the market is subject to significant changes in conditions. Statistical methods of evaluation (e.g. reference to house price indices, sampling) may be used to update estimates or to identify collateral that may have declined in value and that may need re- appraisal. A qualified professional must evaluate the property when information indicates that the value of the collateral may have declined materially relative to general market prices or when a credit event, such as default, occurs.\n",
      " | (4) | Junior liens: In some member countries, eligible collateral will be restricted to situations where the lender has a first charge over the property. Junior liens may be taken into account where there is no doubt that the claim for collateral is legally enforceable and constitutes an efficient credit risk mitigant. Where junior liens are recognized the bank must first take the haircut value of the collateral, then reduce it by the sum of all loans with liens that rank higher than the junior lien, the remaining value is the collateral that supports the loan with the junior lien. In cases where liens are held by third parties that rank pari passu with the lien of the bank, only the proportion of the collateral (after the application of haircuts and reductions due to the value of loans with liens that rank higher than the lien of the bank) that is attributable to the bank may be recognized.\n",

      "16.137 | The bank must have a sound process for determining the credit risk in the receivables. Such a process should include, among other things, analyses of the borrower’s business and industry (e.g. effects of the business cycle) and the types of customers with whom the borrower does business. Where the bank relies on the borrower to ascertain the credit risk of the customers, the bank must review the borrower’s credit policy to ascertain its soundness and credibility.\n",
      "16.138 | The margin between the amount of the exposure and the value of the receivables must reflect all appropriate factors, including the cost of collection, concentration within the receivables pool pledged by an individual borrower, and potential concentration risk within the bank’s total exposures.\n",
      "16.139 | The bank must maintain a continuous monitoring process that is appropriate for the specific exposures (either immediate or contingent) attributable to the collateral to be utilized as a risk mitigant. This process may include, as appropriate and relevant, ageing reports, control of trade documents, borrowing base certificates, frequent audits of collateral, confirmation of accounts, control of the proceeds of accounts paid, analyses of dilution (credits given by the borrower to the issuers) and regular financial analysis of both the borrower and the issuers of the receivables, especially in the case when a small number of large-sized receivables are taken as collateral. Observance of the bank’s overall concentration limits should be monitored. Additionally, compliance with loan covenants, environmental restrictions, and other legal requirements should be reviewed on a regular basis\n",

Where the correlation is high, e.g. where some issuers of the receivables are reliant on the borrower for their viability or the borrower and the issuers belong to a common industry, the attendant risks should be taken into account in the setting of margins for the collateral pool as a whole. Receivables from affiliates of the borrower (including subsidiaries and employees) will not be recognized as risk mitigants.\n",

      "18.1 | Banks must apply the securitization framework for determining regulatory capital requirements on exposures arising from traditional and synthetic securitizations or similar structures that contain features common to both. Since securitizations may be structured in many different ways, the capital treatment of a securitization exposure must be determined on the basis of its economic substance rather than its legal form. Banks are encouraged to consult with SAMA when there is uncertainty about whether a given transaction should be considered a securitization. For example, transactions involving cash flows from real estate (e.g. rents) may be considered specialized lending exposures, if warranted.\n",
      "18.2 | A traditional securitization is a structure where the cash flow from an underlying pool of exposures is used to service at least two different stratified risk positions or tranches reflecting different degrees of credit risk. Payments to the investors depend upon the performance of the specified underlying exposures, as opposed to being derived from an obligation of the entity originating those exposures. The stratified/tranched structures that characterize securitizations differ from ordinary senior/subordinated debt instruments in that junior securitization tranches can absorb losses without interrupting contractual payments to more senior tranches, whereas subordination in a senior/subordinated debt structure is a matter of priority of rights to the proceeds of liquidation.\n",
      "18.3 | A synthetic securitization is a structure with at least two different stratified risk positions or tranches that reflect different degrees of credit risk where credit risk of an underlying pool of exposures is transferred, in whole or in part, through the use of funded (e.g. credit-linked notes) or unfunded (e.g. credit default swaps) credit derivatives or guarantees that serve to hedge the credit risk of the portfolio. Accordingly, the investors’ potential risk is dependent upon the performance of the underlying pool.\n",
      "18.4 | Banks’ exposures to a securitization are hereafter referred to as “securitization exposures”. Securitization exposures can include but are not restricted to the following: asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, credit enhancements, liquidity facilities, interest rate or currency swaps, credit derivatives and tranched cover as described in 9.81 . Reserve accounts, such as cash collateral accounts, recorded as an asset by the originating bank must also be treated as securitization exposures.\n",
      "18.5 | Resecuritization exposure is a securitization exposure in which the risk associated with an underlying pool of exposures is tranched and at least one of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure. In addition, an exposure to one or more resecuritization exposures is a resecuritization exposure. An exposure resulting from retranching of a securitization exposure is not a resecuritization exposure if the bank is able to demonstrate that the cash flows to and from the bank could be replicated in all circumstances and conditions by an exposure to the securitization of a pool of assets that contains no securitization exposures.\n",
      "18.6 | Underlying instruments in the pool being securitized may include but are not restricted to the following: loans, commitments, asset-backed and mortgage- backed securities, corporate bonds, equity securities, and private equity investments. The underlying pool may include one or more exposures.\n",

      "18.7 | For risk-based capital purposes, a bank is considered to be an originator with regard to a certain securitization if it meets either of the following conditions:\n",
      " | (1) | The bank originates directly or indirectly underlying exposures included in the securitization; or\n",
      " | (2) | The bank serves as a sponsor of an asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduit or similar programme that acquires exposures from third-party entities. In the context of such programmes, a bank would generally be considered a sponsor and, in turn, an originator if it, in fact or in substance, manages or advises the programme, places securities into the market, or provides liquidity and/or credit enhancements.\n",
      "18.8 | An ABCP programme predominantly issues commercial paper to third-party investors with an original maturity of one year or less and is backed by assets or other exposures held in a bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity.\n",
      "18.9 | A clean-up call is an option that permits the securitization exposures (e.g. asset- backed securities) to be called before all of the underlying exposures or securitization exposures have been repaid. In the case of traditional securitizations, this is generally accomplished by repurchasing the remaining securitization exposures once the pool balance or outstanding securities have fallen below some specified level. In the case of a synthetic transaction, the clean- up call may take the form of a clause that extinguishes the credit protection.\n",
      "18.10 | A credit enhancement is a contractual arrangement in which the bank or other entity retains or assumes a securitization exposure and, in substance, provide some degree of added protection to other parties to the transaction.\n",

      " | (2) | Is subordinated.\n",
      "18.12 | An early amortization provision is a mechanism that, once triggered, accelerates the reduction of the investor’s interest in underlying exposures of a securitization of revolving credit facilities and allows investors to be paid out prior to the originally stated maturity of the securities issued. A securitization of revolving credit facilities is a securitization in which one or more underlying exposures represent, directly or indirectly, current or future draws on a revolving credit facility. Examples of revolving credit facilities include but are not limited to credit card exposures, home equity lines of credit, commercial lines of credit, and other lines of credit.\n",
      "18.13 | Excess spread (or future margin income) is defined as gross finance charge collections and other income received by the trust or special purpose entity (SPE, as defined below) minus certificate interest, servicing fees, charge-offs, and other senior trust or SPE expenses.\n",
      "18.14 | Implicit support arises when a bank provides support to a securitization in excess of its predetermined contractual obligation.\n",
      "18.15 | For risk-based capital purposes, an internal ratings-based (IRB) pool means a securitization pool for which a bank is able to use an IRB approach to calculate capital requirements for all underlying exposures given that it has approval to apply IRB for the type of underlying exposures and it has sufficient information to calculate IRB capital requirements for these exposures. A bank which has a SAMA-approved IRB approach for the entire pool of exposures underlying a given securitization exposure that cannot estimate capital requirements for all underlying exposures using an IRB approach would be expected to demonstrate to SAMA why it is unable to do so. However, SAMA may prohibit a bank from treating an IRB pool as such in the case of particular structures or transactions, including transactions with highly complex loss allocations, tranches whose credit enhancement could be eroded for reasons other than portfolio losses, and tranches of portfolios with high internal correlations (such as portfolios with high exposure to single sectors or with high geographical concentration).\n",
      "18.16 | For risk-based capital purposes, a mixed pool means a securitization pool for which a bank is able to calculate IRB parameters for some, but not all, underlying exposures in a securitization.\n",
      "18.17 | For risk-based capital purposes, a standardized approach (SA) pool means a securitization pool for which a bank does not have approval to calculate IRB parameters for any underlying exposures; or for which, while the bank has approval to calculate IRB parameters for some or all of the types of underlying exposures, it is unable to calculate IRB parameters for any underlying exposures because of lack of relevant data, or is prohibited by SAMA from treating the pool as an IRB pool pursuant to 18.15.\n",
      "18.18 | A securitization exposure (tranche) is considered to be a senior exposure (tranche) if it is effectively backed or secured by a first claim on the entire amount of the assets in the underlying securitized pool. 69 While this generally includes only the most senior position within a securitization transaction, in some instances there may be other claims that, in a technical sense, may be more senior in the waterfall (e.g. a swap claim) but may be disregarded for the purpose of determining which positions are treated as senior. Different maturities of several senior tranches that share pro rata loss allocation shall have no effect on the seniority of these tranches, since they benefit from the same level of credit enhancement. The material effects of differing tranche maturities are captured by maturity adjustments on the risk weights to be assigned to the securitization exposures. For example:\n",
      " | (1) | In a typical synthetic securitization, an unrated tranche would be treated as a senior tranche, provided that all of the conditions for inferring a rating from a lower tranche that meets the definition of a senior tranche are fulfilled.\n",
      " | (2) | In a traditional securitization where all tranches above the first-loss piece are rated, the most highly rated position would be treated as a senior tranche. When there are several tranches that share the same rating, only the most senior tranche in the cash flow waterfall would be treated as senior (unless the only difference among them is the effective maturity). Also, when the different ratings of several senior tranches only result from a difference in maturity, all of these tranches should be treated as a senior tranche.\n",
      " | (3) | Usually, a liquidity facility supporting an ABCP programme would not be the most senior position within the programme; the commercial paper, which benefits from the liquidity support, typically would be the most senior position. However, a liquidity facility may be viewed as covering all losses on the underlying receivables pool that exceed the amount of overcollateralization/reserves provided by the seller and as being most senior if it is sized to cover all of the outstanding commercial paper and other senior debt supported by the pool, so that no cash flows from the underlying pool could be transferred to the other creditors until any liquidity draws were repaid in full. In such a case, the liquidity facility can be treated as a senior exposure. Otherwise, if these conditions are not satisfied, or if for other reasons the liquidity facility constitutes a mezzanine position in economic substance rather than a senior position in the underlying pool, the liquidity facility should be treated as a nonsenior exposure.\n",
      "18.19 | For risk-based capital purposes, the exposure amount of a securitization exposure is the sum of the on-balance sheet amount of the exposure, or carrying value – which takes into account purchase discounts and writedowns/specific provisions the bank took on this securitization exposure – and the off-balance sheet exposure amount, where applicable.\n",
      "18.20 | A bank must measure the exposure amount of its off-balance sheet securitization exposures as follows:\n",
      " | (1) | For credit risk mitigants sold or purchased by the bank, use the treatment set out in 18.56 to 18.62\n",
      " | (2) | For facilities that are not credit risk mitigants, use a credit conversion factor (CCF) of 100%. If contractually provided for, servicers may advance cash to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments to investors so long as the servicer is entitled to full reimbursement and this right is senior to other claims on cash flows from the underlying pool of exposures. The undrawn portion of servicer cash advances or facilities may receive the CCF for unconditionally cancellable commitments under chapters 5 to 7 and;\n",
      " | (3) | For derivatives contracts other than credit risk derivatives contracts, such as interest rate or currency swaps sold or purchased by the bank, use the measurement approach set out in counterparty credit risk overview chapter of Minimum Capital Requirements for Counterparty Credit Risk and Credit Valuation Adjustment .\n",
      "18.21 | An SPE is a corporation, trust or other entity organized for a specific purpose, the activities of which are limited to those appropriate to accomplish the purpose of the SPE, and the structure of which is intended to isolate the SPE from the credit risk of an originator or seller of exposures. SPEs, normally a trust or similar entity, are commonly used as financing vehicles in which exposures are sold to the SPE in exchange for cash or other assets funded by debt issued by the trust.\n",
      "18.22 | For risk-based capital purposes, tranche maturity ( M T ) is the tranche’s remaining effective maturity in years and can be measured at the bank’s discretion in either of the following manners. In all cases, M T will have a floor of one year and a cap of five years.\n",
      " | (1) | As the euro 70 weighted-average maturity of the contractual cash flows of the tranche, as expressed below, where CF t denotes the cash flows (principal, interest payments and fees) contractually payable by the borrower in period t. The contractual payments must be unconditional and must not be dependent on the actual performance of the securitized assets. If such unconditional contractual payment dates are not available, the final legal maturity shall be used.\n",

      " | (2) | On the basis of final legal maturity of the tranche, where M L is the final legal maturity of the tranche.\n",
      " |  | [EQUATION]\n",
      "18.23 | When determining the maturity of a securitization exposure, banks should take into account the maximum period of time they are exposed to potential losses from the securitized assets. In cases where a bank provides a commitment, the bank should calculate the maturity of the securitization exposure resulting from this commitment as the sum of the contractual maturity of the commitment and the longest maturity of the asset(s) to which the bank would be exposed after a draw has occurred. If those assets are revolving, the longest contractually possible remaining maturity of the asset that might be added during the revolving period would apply, rather than the (longest) maturity of the assets currently in the pool. The same treatment applies to all other instruments where the risk of the commitment/protection provider is not limited to losses realized until the maturity of that instrument (e.g. total return swaps). For credit protection instruments that are only exposed to losses that occur up to the maturity of that instrument, a bank would be allowed to apply the contractual maturity of the instrument and would not have to look through to the protected position.\n",

The exposures are legally isolated from the transferor in such a way (e.g. through the sale of assets or through sub-participation) that the exposures are put beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or receivership. Banks should obtain legal opinion 71 that confirms true sale. The transferor’s retention of servicing rights to the exposures will not necessarily constitute indirect control of the exposures.

Such information may include, as appropriate: exposure type; percentage of loans 30, 60 and 90 days past due; default rates; prepayment rates; loans in foreclosure; property type; occupancy; average credit score or other measures of credit worthiness; average loan-to- value ratio; and industry and geographical diversification. For resecuritizations, banks should have information not only on the underlying securitization tranches, such as the issuer name and credit quality, but also on the characteristics and performance of the pools underlying the securitization tranches.\n",

Similarly, neither general nor specific provisions against securitization exposures or underlying assets still held on the balance sheet of the originator are to be included in the measurement of eligible provisions. However, originator banks can offset 1250% risk-weighted securitization exposures by reducing the securitization exposure amount by the amount of their specific provisions on underlying assets of that transaction and non-refundable purchase price discounts on such underlying assets. Specific provisions on securitization exposures will be taken into account in the calculation of the exposure amount, as defined in 18.19 and 18.20 . General provisions on underlying securitized exposures are not to be taken into account in any calculation.\n",

For example, if a bank provides full credit support to some notes and holds a portion of these notes, its full credit support obligation precludes any loss from its exposure to the notes. If a bank can verify that fulfilling its obligations with respect to exposure A will preclude a loss from its exposure to B under any circumstance, the bank does not need to calculate risk-weighted assets for its exposure B.\n",
      "18.39 | To arrive at an overlap, a bank may, for the purposes of calculating capital requirements, split or expand 72 its exposures. For example, a liquidity facility may not be contractually required to cover defaulted assets or may not fund an ABCP programme in certain circumstances. For capital purposes, such a situation would not be regarded as an overlap to the notes issued by that ABCP conduit. However, the bank may calculate risk-weighted assets for the liquidity facility as if it were expanded (either in order to cover defaulted assets or in terms of trigger events) to preclude all losses on the notes. In such a case, the bank would only need to calculate capital requirements on the liquidity facility.\n",

To assist investors in conducting appropriate and ongoing monitoring of their investments’ performance and so that investors that wish to purchase a securitization in the secondary market have sufficient information to conduct appropriate due diligence, timely loan-level data in accordance with applicable laws or granular pool stratification data on the risk characteristics of the underlying pool and standardized investor reports should be readily available to current and potential investors at least quarterly throughout the life of the securitization. Cut-off dates of the loan-level or granular pool stratification data should be aligned with those used for investor reporting. To provide a level of assurance that the reporting of the underlying credit claims or receivables is accurate and that the underlying credit claims or receivables meet the eligibility requirements, the initial portfolio should be reviewed 86 for conformity with the eligibility requirements by an appropriate legally accountable and independent third party, such as an independent accounting practice or the calculation agent or management company for the securitization.\n",

To help ensure that the underlying credit claims or receivables do not need to be refinanced over a short period of time, there should not be a reliance on the sale or refinancing of the underlying credit claims or receivables in order to repay the liabilities, unless the underlying pool of credit claims or receivables is sufficiently granular and has sufficiently distributed repayment profiles.

To ensure that junior noteholders do not have inappropriate payment preference over senior noteholders that are due and payable, throughout the life of a securitization, or, where there are multiple securitizations backed by the same pool of credit claims or receivables, throughout the life of the securitization programme, junior liabilities should not have payment preference over senior liabilities which are due and payable. The securitization should not be structured as a “reverse” cash flow waterfall such that junior liabilities are paid where due and payable senior liabilities have not been paid. To help provide investors with full transparency over any changes to the cash flow waterfall, payment profile or priority of payments that might affect a securitization, all triggers affecting the cash flow waterfall, payment profile or priority of payments of the securitization should be clearly and fully disclosed both in offering documents and in investor reports, with information in the investor report that clearly identifies the breach status, the ability for the breach to be reversed and the consequences of the breach. Investor reports should contain information that allows investors to monitor the evolution over time of the indicators that are subject to triggers. Any triggers breached between payment dates should be disclosed to investors on a timely basis in accordance with the terms and conditions of all underlying transaction documents.\n",

The party or parties with fiduciary responsibility to the securitization and to investors should be able to demonstrate sufficient skills and resources to comply with their duties of care in the administration of the securitization vehicle. To increase the likelihood that those identified as having a fiduciary responsibility towards investors as well as the servicer execute their duties in full on a timely basis, remuneration should be such that these parties are incentivized and able to meet their responsibilities in full and on a timely basis.\n",

Provisions should be documented for the replacement of servicers, bank account providers, derivatives counterparties and liquidity providers in the event of failure or non- performance or insolvency or other deterioration of creditworthiness of any such counterparty to the securitization. To enhance transparency and visibility over all receipts, payments and ledger entries at all times, the performance reports to investors should distinguish and report the securitization’s income and disbursements, such as scheduled principal, redemption principal, scheduled interest, prepaid principal, past due interest and fees and charges, delinquent, defaulted and restructured amounts under debt forgiveness and payment holidays, including accurate accounting for amounts attributable to principal and interest deficiency ledgers.\n",

      " | (8) | Transaction – An individual transaction in which the ABCP conduit holds a beneficial interest. A transaction may qualify as a securitization, but may also be a direct asset purchase, the acquisition of undivided interest in a replenishing pool of asset, a secured loan etc.\n",
      "18.97 | For exposures at the conduit level (e.g. exposure arising from investing in the commercial papers issued by the ABCP programme or sponsoring arrangements at the conduit/programme level), compliance with the short-term STC capital criteria is only achieved if the criteria are satisfied at both the conduit and transaction levels.\n",

      "18.99 | The sponsor should make representations and warranties to investors that the criterion set out in 18.100 below are met, and explain how this is the case on an overall basis. Only if specified should this be done for each transaction. Provided that each individual underlying transaction is homogeneous in terms of asset type, a conduit may be used to finance transactions of different asset types. Programme wide credit enhancement should not prevent a conduit from qualifying for STC, regardless of whether such enhancement technically creates resecuritisation.\n",

Credit claims or receivables underlying a transaction in a conduit should have contractually identified periodic payment streams relating to rental, 94 principal, interest, or principal and interest payments. Credit claims or receivables generating a single payment stream would equally qualify as eligible.

      " | (3) | Credit claims or receivables included in the securitization should have standard obligations, in terms of rights to payments and/or income from assets and that result in a periodic and well-defined stream of payments to investors. Credit card facilities should be deemed to result in a periodic and well-defined stream of payments to investors for the purposes of this criterion.\n",
      " | (4) | Repayment of the securitization exposure should mainly rely on the principal and interest proceeds from the securitized assets. Partial reliance on refinancing or re-sale of the asset securing the exposure may occur provided that re-financing is sufficiently distributed within the pool and the residual values on which the transaction relies are sufficiently low and that the reliance on refinancing is thus not substantial.\n",

The sponsor should ensure that the seller(s) and all other parties involved in the origination of the receivables have experience in originating same or similar assets, and are supported by a management with industry experience. For the purpose of meeting the short-term STC capital criteria, investors must request confirmation from the sponsor that the performance history of the originator and the original lender for substantially similar claims or receivables to those being securitized has been established for an \"appropriately long period of time”.

      "20.8 | The following operational criteria concerning the use of external credit assessments apply in the securitization framework:\n",
      " | (1) | To be eligible for risk-weighting purposes, the external credit assessment must take into account and reflect the entire amount of credit risk exposure the bank has with regard to all payments owed to it. For example, if a bank is owed both principal and interest, the assessment must fully take into account and reflect the credit risk associated with timely repayment of both principal and interest.\n",
      " | (2) | The external credit assessments must be from an eligible external credit assessment institution (ECAI) as recognized by SAMA in accordance with SAMA Circular No. BCS 242, Date: 11 April 2007 (Mapping of Credit Assessment Ratings Provided by Eligible External Credit Assessment Institution to Determine Risk Weighted Exposures) as outlined in chapter 8 with the following exception. In contrast with 8.3 (3) , an eligible credit assessment, procedures, methodologies, assumptions and the key elements underlying the assessments must be publicly available, on a non-selective basis and free of charge. 109 In other words, a rating must be published in an accessible form and included in the ECAI’s transition matrix. Also, loss and cash flow analysis as well as sensitivity of ratings to changes in the underlying rating assumptions should be publicly available. Consequently, ratings that are made available only to the parties to a transaction do not satisfy this requirement.\n",
      " | (3) | Eligible ECAIs must have a demonstrated expertise in assessing securitizations, which may be evidenced by strong market acceptance.\n",
      " | (4) | Where two or more eligible ECAIs can be used and these assess the credit risk of the same securitization exposure differently, paragraph 8.8 will apply.\n",
      " | (5) | Where credit risk mitigation (CRM) is provided to specific underlying exposures or the entire pool by an eligible guarantor as defined in chapter 9 and is reflected in the external credit assessment assigned to a securitization exposure(s), the risk weight associated with that external credit assessment should be used. In order to avoid any double-counting, no additional capital recognition is permitted. If the CRM provider is not recognized as an eligible guarantor under chapter 9 , the covered securitization exposures should be treated as unrated.\n",
      " | (6) | In the situation where a credit risk mitigant solely protects a specific securitization exposure within a given structure (e.g. asset-backed security tranche) and this protection is reflected in the external credit assessment, the bank must treat the exposure as if it is unrated and then apply the CRM treatment outlined in chapter 9 or in the foundation internal ratings-based (IRB) approach of chapters 10 to 16 , to recognize the hedge.\n",
      " | (7) | A bank is not permitted to use any external credit assessment for risk-weighting purposes where the assessment is at least partly based on unfunded support provided by the bank. For example, if a bank buys asset- backed commercial paper (ABCP) where it provides an unfunded securitization exposure extended to the ABCP programme (e.g. liquidity facility or credit enhancement), and that exposure plays a role in determining the credit assessment on the ABCP, the bank must treat the ABCP as if it were not rated. The bank must continue to hold capital against the other securitization exposures it provides (e.g. against the liquidity facility and/or credit enhancement).\n",

These requirements are intended to ensure that the unrated position is pari passu or senior in all respects to an externally-rated securitization exposure termed the “reference securitization exposure”.\n",
      "20.10 | The following operational requirements must be satisfied to recognize inferred ratings:\n",
      " | (1) | The reference securitization exposure (e.g. asset-backed security) must rank pari passu or be subordinate in all respects to the unrated securitization exposure. Credit enhancements, if any, must be taken into account when assessing the relative subordination of the unrated exposure and the reference securitization exposure. For example, if the reference securitization exposure benefits from any third-party guarantees or other credit enhancements that are not available to the unrated exposure, then the latter may not be assigned an inferred rating based on the reference securitization exposure.\n",
      " | (2) | The maturity of the reference securitization exposure must be equal to or longer than that of the unrated exposure.\n",
      " | (3) | On an ongoing basis, any inferred rating must be updated continuously to reflect any subordination of the unrated position or changes in the external rating of the reference securitization exposure.\n",
      " | (4) | The external rating of the reference securitization exposure must satisfy the general requirements for recognition of external ratings as delineated in 20.8 .\n",

      "21.1 | In the event that banks have securitization exposures where the IAA treatment applies, banks shall notify SAMA of the transactions and seek approval to apply the IAA treatment. Subject to SAMA approval, a bank may use its internal assessments of the credit quality of its securitization exposures extended to ABCP programmes (e.g. liquidity facilities and credit enhancements) provided that the bank has at least one approved IRB model (which does not need to be applicable to the securitized exposures) and if the bank's internal assessment process meets the operational requirements set out below. Internal assessments of exposures provided to ABCP programmes must be mapped to equivalent external ratings of an ECAI. Those rating equivalents are used to determine the appropriate risk weights under the SECERBA for the exposures.\n",
      "21.2 | A bank's internal assessment process must meet the following operational requirements in order to use internal assessments in determining the IRB capital requirement arising from liquidity facilities, credit enhancements, or other exposures extended to an ABCP programme:\n",
      " | (1) | For the unrated exposure to qualify for the internal assessment approach (SEC-IAA), the ABCP must be externally rated. The ABCP itself is subject to the SEC-ERBA.\n",
      " | (2) | The internal assessment of the credit quality of a securitization exposure to the ABCP programme must be based on ECAI criteria for the asset type purchased, and must be the equivalent of at least investment grade when initially assigned to an exposure. In addition, the internal assessment must be used in the bank's internal risk management processes, including management information and economic capital systems, and generally must meet all the relevant requirements of the IRB framework.\n",
      " | (3) | In order for banks to use the SEC-IAA, SAMA must be satisfied\n",
      " |  | (a) | That the ECAI meets the ECAI eligibility criteria outlined in chapter 8 and\n",
      " |  | (b) | With the ECAI rating methodologies used in the process.\n",
      " | (4) | Banks demonstrate to the satisfaction of SAMA how these internal assessments correspond to the relevant ECAI's standards. For instance, when calculating the credit enhancement level in the context of the SEC- IAA, SAMA may, if warranted, disallow on a full or partial basis any seller- provided recourse guarantees or excess spread, or any other first- loss credit enhancements that provide limited protection to the bank.\n",
      " | (5) | The bank's internal assessment process must identify gradations of risk. Internal assessments must correspond to the external ratings of ECAIs.\n",
      " | (6) | The bank's internal assessment process, particularly the stress factors for determining credit enhancement requirements, must be at least as conservative as the publicly available rating criteria of the major ECAIs that are externally rating the ABCP programme's commercial paper for the asset type being purchased by the programme. However, banks should consider, to some extent, all publicly available ECAI rating methodologies in developing their internal assessments.\n",
      " |  | (a) | In the case where the commercial paper issued by an ABCP programme is externally rated by two or more ECAIs and the different ECAIs' benchmark stress factors require different levels of credit enhancement to achieve the same external rating equivalent, the bank must apply the ECAI stress factor that requires the most conservative or highest level of credit protection. For example, if one ECAI required enhancement of 2.5 to 3.5 times historical losses for an asset type to obtain a single A rating equivalent and another required two to three times historical losses, the bank must use the higher range of stress factors in determining the appropriate level of seller-provided credit enhancement.\n",
      " |  | (b) | When selecting ECAIs to externally rate an ABCP, a bank must not choose only those ECAIs that generally have relatively less restrictive rating methodologies. In addition, if there are changes in the methodology of one of the selected ECAIs, including the stress factors, that adversely affect the external rating of the programme's commercial paper, then the revised rating methodology must be considered in evaluating whether the internal assessments assigned to ABCP programme exposures are in need of revision.\n",
      " |  | (c) | A bank cannot utilize an ECAI's rating methodology to derive an internal assessment if the ECAI's process or rating criteria are not publicly available. However, banks should consider the non-publicly available methodology - to the extent that they have access to such information -in developing their internal assessments, particularly if it is more conservative than the publicly available criteria.\n",
      " |  | (d) | In general, if the ECAI rating methodologies for an asset or exposure are not publicly available, then the IAA may not be used. However, in certain instances - for example, for new or uniquely structured transactions, which are not currently addressed by the rating criteria of an ECAI rating the programme's commercial paper - a bank may discuss the specific transaction with SAMA to determine whether the IAA may be applied to the related exposures.\n",
      " | (7) | Internal or external auditors, an ECAI, or the bank's internal credit review or risk management function must perform regular reviews of the internal assessment process and assess the validity of those internal assessments. If the bank's internal audit, credit review or risk management functions perform the reviews of the internal assessment process, then these functions must be independent of the ABCP programme business line, as well as the underlying customer relationships.\n",
      " | (8) | The bank must track the performance of its internal assessments over time to evaluate the performance of the assigned internal assessments and make adjustments, as necessary, to its assessment process when the performance of the exposures routinely diverges from the assigned internal assessments on those exposures.\n",
      " | (9) | The ABCP programme must have credit and investment guidelines, i.e. underwriting standards, for the ABCP programme. In the consideration of an asset purchase, the ABCP programme (i.e. the programme administrator) should develop an outline of the structure of the purchase transaction. Factors that should be discussed include the type of asset being purchased; type and monetary value of the exposures arising from the provision of liquidity facilities and credit enhancements; loss waterfall; and legal and economic isolation of the transferred assets from the entity selling the assets.\n",
      " | (10) | A credit analysis of the asset seller's risk profile must be performed and should consider, for example, past and expected future financial performance; current market position; expected future competitiveness; leverage, cash flow and interest coverage; and debt rating. In addition, a review of the seller's underwriting standards, servicing capabilities and collection processes should be performed.\n",
      " | (11) | The ABCP programme's underwriting policy must establish minimum asset eligibility criteria that, among other things:\n",
      " |  | (a) | Exclude the purchase of assets that are significantly past due or defaulted;\n",
      " |  | (b) | Limit excess concentration to individual obligor or geographical area; and\n",
      " |  | (c) | Limit the tenor of the assets to be purchased.\n",
      " | (12) | The ABCP programme should have collection processes established that consider the operational capability and credit quality of the servicer. The programme should mitigate to the extent possible seller/servicer risk through various methods, such as triggers based on current credit quality that would preclude commingling of funds and impose lockbox arrangements that would help ensure the continuity of payments to the ABCP programme.\n",
      " | (13) | The aggregate estimate of loss on an asset pool that the ABCP programme is considering purchasing must consider all sources of potential risk, such as credit and dilution risk. If the seller-provided credit enhancement is sized based on only credit-related losses, then a separate reserve should be established for dilution risk, if dilution risk is material for the particular exposure pool. In addition, in sizing the required enhancement level, the bank should review several years of historical information, including losses, delinquencies, dilutions and the turnover rate of the receivables. Furthermore, the bank should evaluate the characteristics of the underlying asset pool (e.g. weighted-average credit score) and should identify any concentrations to an individual obligor or geographical region and the granularity of the asset pool.\n",

Exposures related to the securitization that should be treated as exposures in the pool could include assets in which the SPE may have invested a reserve account, such as a cash collateral account or claims against counterparties resulting from interest swaps or currency swaps. 112 Notwithstanding, the bank can exclude the SPE's exposures from the pool for capital calculation purposes if the bank can demonstrate to SAMA that the risk of the SPE's exposures is immaterial (for example, because it has been mitigated 113 ) or that it does not affect the bank's securitization exposure.\n",

      "23.1 | A non-performing loan securitization (NPL securitization) means a securitization where the underlying pool's variable W, as defined in 19.6 , is equal to or higher than 90% at the origination cut-off date and at any subsequent date on which assets are added to or removed from the underlying pool due to replenishment, restructuring or any other relevant reason. The underlying pool of exposures of an NPL securitization may only comprise loans, loan-equivalent financial instruments or tradable instruments used for the sole purpose of loan sub-participation as referred to in 18.24 (2) . Loan-equivalent financial instruments include, for example, bonds not listed on a trading venue. For the avoidance of doubt, an NPL securitization may not be backed by exposures to other securitizations.\n",
      "23.2 | SAMA may provide for a stricter definition of NPL securitizations than that laid out in 23.1 above. For these purposes, SAMA may:\n",
      " | (1) | Raise the minimum level of W to a level higher than 90%; or\n",
      " | (2) | Require that the non-delinquent exposures in the underlying pool comply with a set of minimum criteria, or preclude certain types of non-delinquent exposures from forming part of the underlying pools of NPL securitizations.\n",
      "23.3 | A bank is precluded from applying the SEC-IRBA to an exposure to an NPL securitization where the bank uses the foundation approach as referred to in 10.35 to calculate the KIRB of the underlying pool of exposures.\n",

      "23.5 | Where, according to the hierarchy of approaches in 18.41 to 18.47 , the bank must use the SEC-IRBA or the SEC-SA, a bank may apply a risk weight of 100% to the senior tranche of an NPL securitization provided that the NPL securitization is a traditional securitization and the sum of the non- refundable purchase price discounts (NRPPD), calculated as described in 23.6 below, is equal to or higher than 50% of the outstanding balance of the pool of exposures.\n",
      "23.6 | For the purposes of 23.5, NRPPD is the difference between the outstanding balance of the exposures in the underlying pool and the price at which these exposures are sold by the originator to the securitization entity, when neither originator nor the original lender are reimbursed for this difference. In cases where the originator underwrites tranches of the NPL securitization for subsequent sale, the NRPPD may include the differences between the nominal amount of the tranches and the price at which these tranches are first sold to unrelated third parties. For any given piece of a securitization tranche, only its initial sale from the originator to investors is taken into account in the determination of NRPPD. The purchase prices of subsequent re-sales are not considered.\n",

The same applies to an investor bank, provided that it is using the SEC-IRBA for an exposure to the NPL securitization.\n",

      "24.1 | Equity investments in funds that are held in the banking book must be treated in a manner consistent with one or more of the following three approaches, which vary in their risk sensitivity and conservatism: the “look-through approach” (LTA), the “mandate-based approach” (MBA), and the “fall-back approach” (FBA). The requirements set out in this chapter apply to banks’ equity investments in all types of funds, including off-balance sheet exposures (e.g. unfunded commitments to subscribe to a fund’s future capital calls). Exposures, including underlying exposures held by funds, that are required to be deducted according to the Regulatory Capital Under Basel III Framework ( SAMA Circular No. 341000015689, Date: 19 December 2012 ) are excluded from the risk weighting treatment outlined in this chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.2 | The LTA requires a bank to risk weight the underlying exposures of a fund as if the exposures were held directly by the bank. This is the most granular and risk-sensitive approach. It must be used when:\n",
      " | (1) | There is sufficient and frequent information provided to the bank regarding the underlying exposures of the fund; and\n",
      " | (2) | Such information is verified by an independent third party.\n",
      "24.3 | To satisfy condition (1) above, the frequency of financial reporting of the fund must be the same as, or more frequent than, that of the bank’s and the granularity of the financial information must be sufficient to calculate the corresponding risk weights. To satisfy condition (2) above, there must be verification of the underlying exposures by an independent third party, such as the depository or the custodian bank or, where applicable, the management company. 115\n",
      "24.4 | Under the LTA banks must risk weight all underlying exposures of the fund as if those exposures were directly held. This includes, for example, any underlying exposure arising from the fund’s derivatives activities for situations in which the underlying receives a risk weighting treatment under the calculation of minimum risk based capital requirements and the associated counterparty credit risk (CCR) exposure. Instead of determining a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) charge associated with the fund’s derivatives exposures in accordance with the Minimum Capital Requirements for CVA, banks must multiply the CCR exposure by a factor of 1.5 before applying the risk weight associated with the counterparty. 116\n",
      "24.5 | Banks may rely on third-party calculations for determining the risk weights associated with their equity investments in funds (i.e. the underlying risk weights of the exposures of the fund) if they do not have adequate data or information to perform the calculations themselves. In such cases, the applicable risk weight shall be 1.2 times higher than the one that would be applicable if the exposure were held directly by the bank. 117\n",
      "\n",
      "24.6 | The second approach, the MBA, provides a method for calculating regulatory capital that can be used when the conditions for applying the LTA are not met.\n",
      "24.7 | Under the MBA, banks may use the information contained in a fund's mandate or in the national regulations governing such investment funds. 118 To ensure that all underlying risks are taken into account (including CCR) and that the MBA renders capital requirements no less than the LTA, the risk- weighted assets for the fund's exposures are calculated as the sum of the following three items :\n",
      " | (1) | Balance sheet exposures (i.e. the funds' assets) are risk weighted assuming the underlying portfolios are invested to the maximum extent allowed under the fund's mandate in those assets attracting the highest capital requirements, and then progressively in those other assets implying lower capital requirements. If more than one risk weight can be applied to a given exposure, the maximum risk weight applicable must be used. 119\n",
      " | (2) | Whenever the underlying risk of a derivative exposure or an off-balance-sheet item receives a risk weighting treatment under the risk-based capital requirements standards, the notional amount of the derivative position or of the off-balance sheet exposure is risk weighted accordingly. 120 121\n",
      " | (3) | The CCR associated with the fund's derivative exposures is calculated using the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk (S A-CC R, see standardized approach for counterparty credit risk ). SA-CCR calculates the counterparty credit risk exposure of a netting set of derivatives by multiplying (i) the sum of the replacement cost and potential future exposure; by (ii) an alpha factor set at 1.4. Whenever the replacement cost is unknown, the exposure measure for CCR will be calculated in a conservative manner by using the sum of the notional amounts of the derivatives in the netting set as a proxy for the replacement cost, and the multiplier used in the calculation of the potential future exposure will be equal to 1. Whenever the potential future exposure is unknown, it will be calculated as 15% of the sum of the notional values of the derivatives in the netting set. 122 The risk weight associated with the counterparty is applied to the counterparty credit risk exposure. Instead of determining a CVA charge associated with the fund's derivative exposures in accordance with the Minimum Capital Requirements for CVA, banks must multiply the CCR exposure by a factor of 1.5 before applying the risk weight associated with the counterparty. 123\n",
      "\n",
      "24.8 | Where neither the LTA nor the MBA is feasible, banks are required to apply the FBA. The FBA applies a 1250% risk weight to the bank’s equity investment in the fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.9 | When a bank has an investment in a fund (e.g. Fund A) that itself has an investment in another fund (e.g. Fund B), which the bank identified by using either the LTA or the MBA, the risk weight applied to the investment of the first fund (i.e. Fund A’s investment in Fund B) can be determined by using one of the three approaches set out above. For all subsequent layers (e.g. Fund B’s investments in Fund C and so forth), the risk weights applied to an investment in another fund (Fund C) can be determined by using the LTA under the condition that the LTA was also used for determining the risk weight for the investment in the fund at the previous layer (Fund B). Otherwise, the FBA must be applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.10 | A bank may use a combination of the three approaches when determining the capital requirements for an equity investment in an individual fund, provided that the conditions set out in paragraphs 24.1 to 24.12 are met.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.11 | Leverage is defined as the ratio of total assets to total equity. Leverage is taken into account in the MBA by using the maximum financial leverage permitted in the fund’s mandate or in the national regulation governing the fund.\n",
      "24.12 | When determining the capital requirement related to its equity investment in a fund, a bank must apply a leverage adjustment to the average risk weight of the fund, as set out in 24.13, subject to a cap of 1250%.\n",
      "24.13 | After calculating the total risk-weighted assets of the fund according to the LTA or the MBA, banks will calculate the average risk weight of the fund (Avg RWfund) by dividing the total risk-weighted assets by the total assets of the fund.\n",
      " | Using Avg RWfund and taking into account the leverage of a fund (Lvg), the risk- weighted assets for a bank’s equity investment in a fund can be represented as follows:\n",
      " | RWAinvestment = Avg RWfund * Lvg * equity investment\n",
      "24.14 | The effect of the leverage adjustments depends on the underlying riskiness of the portfolio (i.e. the average risk weight) as obtained by applying the standardized approach or the IRB approaches for credit risk. The formula can therefore be re- written as:\n",
      " | RWAinvestment = RWAfund * percentage of shares\n",
      "\n",
      "24.15 | Equity investments in funds that are held in the banking book must be treated in a consistent manner based on 24.1 to 24.14 , as adjusted by 24.16 to 24.17. | \n",
      "24.16 | Under the LTA: | \n",
      " | (1) | Banks using an IRB approach must calculate the IRB risk components (i.e. PD of the underlying exposures and, where applicable, LGD and EAD) associated with the fund’s underlying exposures (except where the underlying exposures are equity exposures, in respect of which the standardized approach must be used as required by 10.34 ).\n",
      " | (2) | Banks using an IRB approach may use the standardized approach for credit risk ( chapter 7 ) when applying risk weights to the underlying components of funds if they are permitted to do so under the provisions relating to the adoption of the IRB approach set out in chapter 10 in the case of directly held investments. In addition, when an IRB calculation is not feasible(e.g. the bank cannot assign the necessary risk components to the underlying exposures in a manner consistent with its own underwriting criteria), the methods set out in 24.17 below must be used.\n",
      " | (3) | Banks may rely on third-party calculations for determining the risk weights associated with their equity investments in funds (i.e. the underlying risk weights of the exposures of the fund) if they do not have adequate data or information to perform the calculations themselves. In this case, the third party must use the methods set out in 24.17 below, with the applicable risk weight set 1.2 times higher than the one that would be applicable if the exposure were held directly by the bank.\n",
      "24.17 | In cases when the IRB calculation is not feasible (24.16 (2) above), a third-party is performing the calculation of risk weights (24.16 (3) above) or when the bank is using the MBA the following methods must be used to determine the risk weights associated with the fund’s underlying exposures:\n",
      " | (1) | For securitization exposures, the Securitization External-ratings-based approach (SEC-ERBA) set out in chapter 20 ; the Standardized approach (SEC-SA) set out in chapter 19 , if the bank is not able to use the SECERBA; or a 1250% risk weight where the specified requirements for using the SEC-ERBA or SEC-SA are not met; and\n",

      "\n",
      "25.1 | Banks are exposed to the risk associated with unsettled securities, commodities, and foreign exchange transactions from trade date. Irrespective of the booking or the accounting of the transaction, unsettled transactions must be taken into account for regulatory capital requirements purposes.\n",
      "25.2 | Banks are encouraged to develop, implement and improve systems for tracking and monitoring the credit risk exposure arising from unsettled transactions and failed trades as appropriate so that they can produce management information that facilitates timely action. Banks must closely monitor securities, commodities, and foreign exchange transactions that have failed, starting the first day they fail.\n",
      "Delivery-versus-payment transactions\n",
      "25.3 | Transactions settled through a delivery-versus-payment system (DvP), 124 providing simultaneous exchanges of securities for cash, expose firms to a risk of loss on the difference between the transaction valued at the agreed settlement price and the transaction valued at current market price (i.e. positive current exposure). Banks must calculate a capital requirement for such exposures if the payments have not yet taken place five business days after the settlement date, see paragraph 25.9 below.\n",
      "\n",
      "Non-delivery-versus-payment transactions (free deliveries)\n",
      "25.4 | Transactions where cash is paid without receipt of the corresponding receivable (securities, foreign currencies, gold, or commodities) or, conversely, deliverables were delivered without receipt of the corresponding cash payment (non-DvP, or free deliveries) expose firms to a risk of loss on the full amount of cash paid or deliverables delivered. Banks that have made the first contractual payment/delivery leg must calculate a capital requirement for the exposure if the second leg has not been received by the end of the business day. The requirement increases if the second leg has not been received within five business days. See paragraphs 25.10 to 25.12\n",
      "\n",
      "25.5 | The capital treatment set out in this chapter is applicable to all transactions on securities, foreign exchange instruments, and commodities that give rise to a risk of delayed settlement or delivery. This includes transactions through recognized clearing houses and central counterparties that are subject to daily mark-to- market and payment of daily variation margins and that involve a mismatched trade. The treatment does not apply to the instruments that are subject to the counterparty credit risk requirements set out in the Minimum Capital Requirements for Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) and Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) (i.e. over-the-counter derivatives, exchange- traded derivatives, long settlement transactions, securities financing transactions).\n",
      "25.6 | Where they do not appear on the balance sheet (i.e. settlement date accounting), the unsettled exposure amount will receive a 100% credit conversion factor to determine the credit equivalent amount.\n",
      "25.7 | In cases of a system-wide failure of a settlement, clearing system or central counterparty, SAMA may waive capital requirements until the situation is rectified.\n",
      "25.8 | Failure of a counterparty to settle a trade in itself will not be deemed a default for purposes of credit risk under the Basel Framework.\n",
      "\n",
      "25.9 | For DvP transactions, if the payments have not yet taken place five business days after the settlement date, firms must calculate a capital requirement by multiplying the positive current exposure of the transaction by the appropriate factor, according to the Table 34 below.\n",

      "25.10 | For non-DvP transactions (i.e. free deliveries), after the first contractual payment/delivery leg, the bank that has made the payment will treat its exposure as a loan if the second leg has not been received by the end of the business day. 125 This means that:\n",
      " | (1) | For counterparties to which the bank applies the standardized approach to credit risk, the bank will use the risk weight applicable to the counterparty set out in chapter 7 .\n",
      " | (2) | For counterparties to which the bank applies the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach to credit risk, the bank will apply the appropriate IRB formula (set out in chapter 11 ) applicable to the counterparty (set out in chapter 10 ). When applying this requirement, if the bank has no other banking book exposures to the counterparty (that are subject to the IRB approach), the bank may assign a probability of default to the counterparty on the basis of its external rating. Banks using the Advanced IRB approach may use a 45% loss-given- default (LGD) in lieu of estimating LGDs so long as they apply it to all failed trade exposures. Alternatively, banks using the IRB approach may opt to apply the standardized approach risk weights applicable to the counterparty set out in chapter 7 .\n",
      "25.11 | As an alternative to 25.10 (1) and 25.10 (2) above, when exposures are not material, banks may choose to apply a uniform 100% risk-weight to these exposures, in order to avoid the burden of a full credit assessment.\n",
      "25.12 | If five business days after the second contractual payment/delivery date the second leg has not yet effectively taken place, the bank that has made the first payment leg will risk weight the full amount of the value transferred plus replacement cost, if any, at 1250%. This treatment will apply until the second payment/delivery leg is effectively made.\n",

The inputs used to calculate the illustrative risk weights include measures of the probability of default (PD), loss-given-default (LGD), and an assumed effective maturity (M) of 2.5 years, where applicable.\n",

If there is insufficient information for ascertaining the ranking of the other liens, the bank should assume that these liens rank pari passu with the junior lien held by the bank. This treatment does not apply to exposures that are risk weighted according to the loan splitting approach (paragraphs 7.75 and 7.78), where the junior lien would be taken into account in the calculation of the value of the property. The bank will first determine the “base” risk weight based on Tables 9, 10, 11 or 12 as applicable and adjust the “base” risk weight by a multiplier of 1.25, for application to the loan amount of the junior lien.

This gives total risk weighted assets for the exposure of SAR 22,250 = (0.20 * SAR 55,000) + (0.75 * SAR 15,000). 30 Where there are liens on the property that are not held by the bank, the part of the exposure up to 55% of the property value should be reduced by the amount of the senior liens not held by the bank and by a pro-rata percentage of any liens pari passu with the bank’s lien but not held by the bank.

It is also assumed that the second-loss dilution guarantee explicitly covers dilution losses above €50,000 up to €300,000. If the guarantee instead covered €250,000 dilution losses after the purchase discount has been depleted (irrespective of whether the purchase discount has been used for dilution or default losses), then the senior note holder should assume that he is exposed to dilution losses from €250,000 up to €1,000,000 (instead of €0 to €50,000 + €300,000 to €1,000,000). 133 The correct application of the overall risk weight floor is such that the intermediate results (in this case the risk weight for Tranche A*) are calculated without the floor and the floor is only enforced in the last step (ie Step 3(b)).\n",

      "Scope of Application of Basel Framework\n",
      "Since the implementation of Basel II - SAMA’s Detailed Guidance Document Circular No.BCS290 dated June 2006 , all local banks 1 were required to apply the SAMA’s Basel requirements on a standalone and consolidated basis. The scope of application include, applying the framework to any holding company that is the parent entity within a banking group to ensure that it captures the risks of the banking group as a whole. As such, SAMA applies the framework to all local banks on a consolidated level and at every tier within the bank group, depending on the group structure to ensure that it captures the risk of the whole group, taking into account risks arising from individual entities in the group.\n",
      "The scope remains unchanged since the issuance of Basel II –Detailed Guidance Document relating to Pillar 1 issued by SAMA in 2006 in addition, the prudential returns requirements are also aligned to the scope of application implemented by SAMA.\n",
      "1 Local Banks who are engaged predominantly in banking business including licensed subsidiaries of banks located outside the kingdom, operating in Saudi Arabia.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "The Basel Framework comprises the minimum risk-based capital including the relevant capital buffers, leverage, liquidity and large exposure standards, the supervisory review process under Pillar 2 and public disclosures under Pillar 3, and designed to be applied on internationally active banks. The Basel framework is applied on a consolidated basis at the holding company level and at every tier within a banking group, depending on the group structure to ensure that it captures the risk of the whole banking group, taking into account risks arising from individual entities in the group.\n",
      "Objective\n",
      "The objectives of this Guidance Note is to clarify SAMA’s policy on the scope of application of the SAMA’s Basel Framework and the corresponding reporting requirements in view of banks’ enquiries on the revised Framework issued by SAMA in 2021 and 2022 as well as setting out SAMA’s expectations on banks’ group-wide risk oversight and monitoring practices. Banks should refer to the relevant policies on the specific requirements of the SAMA’s Basel Framework.\n",
      "Definition\n",
      "For the purpose of this Guidance Note only:\n",
      "The Framework: Refers to SAMA Basel Framework which includes the minimum risk-based capital and the relevant capital buffers, leverage, liquidity and large exposure standards, the supervisory review process under Pillar 2 and public disclosures under Pillar 3 .\n",
      "Standalone (Solo) level: Refers to the local bank entity excluding it subsidiaries. For the avoidance of doubt, standalone level includes domestic and foreign branches and representative offices.\n",
      "Consolidated level: Refers to the local bank entity and all consolidated financial subsidiaries 2 where the bank have a majority ownership or – controlled.\n",
      "Majority Ownership or –Controlled: Refers to ownership structure where one entity holds 50% or more of the equity of another entity or meet the control definition in the IFRS standards.\n",
      "Financial subsidiary: Refers to a subsidiary engaged in predominantly financial activities 3 including, but not limited to, investment firms , finance companies, payment companies and special purpose vehicles (SPVs) established to undertake financial-related activities.\n",
      "2 Financial subsidiary does not include insurance company. 3 Financial activities include financial leasing, issuing credit cards, portfolio management, investment advisory, custodial and safekeeping services and other similar activities that are ancillary to the business of banking.\n",
      "Application of the Framework on Banking Groups in Saudi Arabia and Reporting Requirements\n",
      "Scope of Application\n",
      "4 For avoidance of doubt, the Framework does not apply to branches of a bank licensed in another jurisdiction operating in Saudi Arabia (“foreign bank branches”). Foreign bank branches are to comply with their home regulator’s prudential requirements. 5 The minority interests (capital held by third parties) that arise can only be recognized in consolidated capital only if they meet the applicable definition of capital in SAMA's Final Guidance Document Concerning Implementation of Capital Reforms . Any minority interest in excess of the subsidiaries’ minimum regulatory capital requirements is not recognized. 6 For example subsidiaries acquired through debt previously contracted and held on a temporary basis, or subject to different laws and regulation that conflict with SAMA regulatory requirements. 7 The application will be restricted to financial subsidiaries that can follows SAMA regulatory requirements\n",

      "1.1 | The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the Basel III: Finalizing post-crisis reforms in December 2017, which includes among others, the revised framework for Credit Risk aimed to enhance the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches, balances simplicity of the framework and, comparability in the calculation of risk weighted assets (RWAs) for credit risk using different available approaches.\n",
      "1.2 | This revised framework in risk-weighted assets for credit risk is issued by SAMA in exercise of the authority vested in SAMA under the Charter issued via Royal Decree No. M/36 dated 11/04/1442H , and the Banking Control Law issued 01/01/1386H .\n",

      "5.1 | Banks can choose between two broad methodologies for calculating their risk-based capital requirements for credit risk. The first is the standardized approach, which is set out in chapters 6 to 9 : | \n",
      " | i. | The standardized approach assigns standardized risk weights to exposures as described in chapter 7 . Risk weighted assets are calculated as the product of the standardized risk weights and the exposure amount. Exposures should be risk-weighted net of specific provisions (including partial write-offs).\n",
      " | ii. | To determine the risk weights in the standardized approach for certain exposure classes, banks may, as a starting point, use assessments by external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs) that are recognized as eligible for capital purposes by SAMA. The requirements covering the use of external ratings are set out in chapter 8 . 1\n",
      " | iii. | The credit risk mitigation techniques that are permitted to be recognized under the standardized approach are set out in chapter 9 .\n",
      "5.2 | The second risk-weighted assets approach is the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, which allows banks to use their internal rating systems for credit risk. The IRB approach is set out in chapters 10 to 16 . Banks must seek SAMA’s regulatory approval before they can use the IRB Approach for calculation of capital requirements for credit risk, subject to the Bank meeting all minimum requirements for the use of IRB Approach, supervisory review and validation exercise as may be carried out by SAMA. | \n",

      " | 3. | Exposures arising from unsettled transactions and failed trades ( chapter 25 ).\n",
      "\n",
      "6.1 | Banks must perform due diligence to ensure that they have an adequate understanding, at origination and thereafter on a regular basis (at least annually), of the risk profile and characteristics of their counterparties. In cases where ratings are used, due diligence is necessary to assess the risk of the exposure for risk management purposes and whether the risk weight applied is appropriate and prudent. The sophistication of the due diligence should be appropriate to the size and complexity of banks’ activities. Banks must take reasonable and adequate steps to assess the operating and financial performance levels and trends through internal credit analysis and/or other analytics outsourced to a third party, as appropriate for each counterparty. Banks must be able to access information about their counterparties on a regular basis to complete due diligence analyses.\n",
      "6.2 | For exposures to entities belonging to consolidated groups, due diligence should, to the extent possible, be performed at the solo entity level to which there is a credit exposure. In evaluating the repayment capacity of the solo entity, banks are expected to take into account the support of the group and the potential for it to be adversely impacted by problems in the group.\n",
      "6.3 | Banks should have in place effective internal policies, processes, systems and controls to ensure that the appropriate risk weights are assigned to counterparties. Banks must be able to demonstrate to SAMA that their due diligence analyses are appropriate.\n",

However, where junior liens 20 provide the holder with a claim for collateral that is legally enforceable and constitute an effective credit risk mitigant, junior liens held by a different bank than the one holding the senior lien mayalso be recognized. 21 In order to meet the above requirements, the national frameworks governing liens should ensure the following: (i) each bank holding a lien on a property can initiate the sale of the property independently from other entities holding a lien on the property; and (ii) where the sale of the property is not carried out by means of a public auction, entities holding a senior lien take reasonable steps to obtain a fair market value or the best price that may be obtained in the circumstances when exercising any power of sale on their own (i.e. it is not possible for the entity holding the senior lien to sell the property on its own at a discounted value in detriment of the junior lien).\n",

      " | 2. | Value of the property :\n",
      " |  | The valuation must be appraised independently 25 using prudently conservative valuation criteria. To ensure that the value of the property is appraised in a prudently conservative manner, the valuation must exclude expectations on price increases and must be adjusted to take into account the potential for the current market price to be significantly above the value that would be sustainable over the life of the loan. 26\n",

The primary source of these cash flows would generally be lease or rental payments, or the sale of the property. The distinguishing characteristic of these exposures compared to other regulatory real estate exposures is that both the servicing of the loan and the prospects for recovery in the event of default depend materially on the cash flows generated by the property securing the exposure.\n",

For example, for a loan of SAR 70,000 to an individual secured on a property valued at SAR 100,000, where there is also a senior ranking lien of SAR 10,000 held by another institution, the bank will apply a risk weight of 20% to SAR 45,000 (=max (SAR 55,000 – SAR 10,000, 0)) of the exposure and, according to paragraph 7.81 a risk weight of 75% to the residual exposure of SAR 25,000.

      "8.2 | Only credit assessments from credit rating agencies recognized as external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs) will be allowed. SAMA will determine on a continuous basis whether an ECAI meets the criteria listed in 8.3 and recognition will only be provided in respect of ECAI ratings for types of exposure where all criteria and conditions are met. SAMA will also take into account the criteria and conditions provided in the International Organization of Securities Commissions' Code of Conduct Fundamentals for Credit Rating Agencies when determining ECAI eligibility.\n",
      "Eligibility criteria\n",
      "8.3 | An ECAI must satisfy each of the following eight criteria.\n",
      " | (1) | Objectivity :\n",
      " |  | The methodology for assigning external ratings must be rigorous, systematic, and subject to some form of validation based on historical experience. Moreover, external ratings must be subject to ongoing review and responsive to changes in financial condition. Before being recognized by SAMA, a rating methodology for each market segment, including rigorous back testing, must have been established for at least one year and preferably three years.\n",
      " | (2) | Independence :\n",
      " |  | An ECAI should be independent and should not be subject to political or economic pressures that may influence the rating. In particular, an ECAI should not delay or refrain from taking a rating action based on its potential effect (economic, political or otherwise). The rating process should be as free as possible from any constraints that could arise in situations where the composition of the board of directors or the shareholder structure of the credit rating agency may be seen as creating a conflict of interest. Furthermore, an ECAI should separate operationally, legally and, if practicable, physically its rating business from other businesses and analysts.\n",
      " | (3) | International access/transparency:\n",
      " |  | The individual ratings, the key elements underlining the ratings assessments and whether the issuer participated in the rating process should be publicly available on a non-selective basis, unless they are private ratings, which should be at least available to both domestic and foreign institutions with legitimate interest and on equivalent terms. In addition, the ECAI’s general procedures, methodologies and assumptions for arriving at ratings should be publicly available.\n",
      " | (4) | Disclosure:\n",
      " |  | An ECAI should disclose the following information: its code of conduct; the general nature of its compensation arrangements with assessed entities; any conflict of interest, the ECAI's compensation arrangements, its rating assessment methodologies, including the definition of default, the time horizon, and the meaning of each rating; the actual default rates experienced in each assessment category; and the transitions of the ratings, e.g. the likelihood of AA ratings becoming A over time. A rating should be disclosed as soon as practicably possible after issuance. When disclosing a rating, the information should be provided in plain language, indicating the nature and limitation of credit ratings and the risk of unduly relying on them to make investments.\n",
      " | (5) | Resources :\n",
      " |  | An ECAI should have sufficient resources to carry out high-quality credit assessments. These resources should allow for substantial ongoing contact with senior and operational levels within the entities assessed in order to add value to the credit assessments. In particular, ECAIs should assign analysts with appropriate knowledge and experience to assess the creditworthiness of the type of entity or obligation being rated. Such assessments should be based on methodologies combining qualitative and quantitative approaches.\n",
      " | (6) | Credibility :\n",
      " |  | To some extent, credibility is derived from the criteria above. In addition, the reliance on an ECAI’s external ratings by independent parties (investors, insurers, trading partners) is evidence of the credibility of the ratings of an ECAI. The credibility of an ECAI is also underpinned by the existence of internal procedures to prevent the misuse of confidential information. In order to be eligible for recognition, an ECAI does not have to assess firms in more than one country.\n",
      " | (7) | Cooperation with SAMA:\n",
      " |  | ECAIs should notify SAMA of significant changes to methodologies and provide access to external ratings and other relevant data in order to support initial and continued determination of eligibility.\n",
      "8.4 | Regarding the disclosure of conflicts of interest referenced in paragraph 8.3(4) above, at a minimum, the following situations and their influence on the ECAI’s credit rating methodologies or credit rating actions shall be disclosed:\n",
      " | (1) | The ECAI is being paid to issue a credit rating by the rated entity or by the obligor, originator, underwriter, or arranger of the rated obligation;\n",
      " | (2) | The ECAI is being paid by subscribers with a financial interest that could be affected by a credit rating action of the ECAI;\n",
      " | (3) | The ECAI is being paid by rated entities, obligors, originators, underwriters, arrangers, or subscribers for services other than issuing credit ratings or providing access to the ECAI’s credit ratings;\n",
      " | (4) | The ECAI is providing a preliminary indication or similar indication of credit quality to an entity, obligor, originator, underwriter, or arranger prior to being hired to determine the final credit rating for the entity, obligor, originator, underwriter, or arranger; and\n",
      " | (5) | The ECAI has a direct or indirect ownership interest in a rated entity or obligor, or a rated entity or obligor has a direct or indirect ownership interest in the ECAI.\n",
      "8.5 | Regarding the disclosure of an ECAI's compensation arrangements referenced in (4) above:\n",
      " | (1) | An ECAI should disclose the general nature of its compensation arrangements with rated entities, obligors, lead underwriters, or arrangers.\n",
      " | (2) | When the ECAI receives from a rated entity, obligor, originator, lead underwriter, or arranger compensation unrelated to its credit rating services, the ECAI should disclose such unrelated compensation as a percentage of total annual compensation received from such rated entity, obligor, lead underwriter, or arranger in the relevant credit rating report or elsewhere, as appropriate.\n",
      " | (3) | An ECAI should disclose in the relevant credit rating report or elsewhere, as appropriate, if it receives 10% or more of its annual revenue from a single client (e.g. a rated entity, obligor, originator, lead underwriter, arranger, or subscriber, or any of their affiliates).\n",

      "8.13 | Where a bank invests in a particular issue that has an issue-specific rating, the risk weight of the exposure will be based on this rating. Where the bank’s exposure is not an investment in a specific rated issue, the following general principles apply.\n",
      " | (1) | In circumstances where the borrower has a specific rating for an issued debt – but the bank’s exposure is not an investment in this particular debt – a high-quality credit rating (one which maps into a risk weight lower than that which applies to an unrated exposure) on that specific debt may only be applied to the bank’s unrated exposure if this exposure ranks in all respects pari passu or senior to the exposure with a rating. If not, the external rating cannot be used and the unassessed exposure will receive the risk weight for unrated exposures.\n",
      " | (2) | In circumstances where the borrower has an issuer rating, this rating typically applies to senior unsecured exposures to that issuer. Consequently, only senior exposures to that issuer will benefit from a high-quality issuer rating. Other unassessed exposures of a highly rated issuer will be treated as unrated. If either the issuer or a single issue has a low-quality rating (mapping into a risk weight equal to or higher than that which applies to unrated exposures), an unassessed exposure to the same counterparty that ranks pari passu or is subordinated to either the senior unsecured issuer rating or the exposure with a low-quality rating will be assigned the same risk weight as is applicable to the low-quality rating.\n",
      " | (3) | In circumstances where the issuer has a specific high-quality rating (one which maps into a lower risk weight) that only applies to a limited class of liabilities (such as a deposit rating or a counterparty risk rating), this may only be used in respect of exposures that fall within that class.\n",
      "8.14 | Whether the bank intends to rely on an issuer- or an issue-specific rating, the rating must take into account and reflect the entire amount of credit risk exposure the bank has with regard to all payments owed to it. For example, if a bank is owed both principal and interest, the rating must fully take into account and reflect the credit risk associated with repayment of both principal and interest.\n",
      "8.15 | In order to avoid any double-counting of credit enhancement factors, no supervisory recognition of credit risk mitigation techniques will be taken into account if the credit enhancement is already reflected in the issue specific rating (see paragraph 9.5 ).\n",
      "Domestic currency and foreign currency ratings\n",
      "8.16 | Where exposures are risk-weighted based on the rating of an equivalent exposure to that borrower, the general rule is that foreign currency ratings would be used for exposures in foreign currency. Domestic currency ratings, if separate, would only be used to risk-weight exposures denominated in the domestic currency 36 .\n",
      "Short-term/long-term ratings\n",
      "8.17 | For risk-weighting purposes, short-term ratings are deemed to be issue-specific. They can only be used to derive risk weights for exposures arising from the rated facility. They cannot be generalized to other short-term exposures, except under the conditions in paragraph 8.19. In no event can a short-term rating be used to support a risk weight for an unrated long-term exposure. Short-term ratings may only be used for short-term exposures against banks and corporates.

      " | (2) | When there is a short-term rating and such a rating maps into a risk weight that is more favorable (i.e. lower) or identical to that derived from the general preferential treatment, the short-term rating should be used for the specific exposure only. Other short-term exposures would benefit from the general preferential treatment.\n",
      " | (3) | When a specific short-term rating for a short term exposure to a bank maps into a less favorable (higher) risk weight, the general short-term preferential treatment for interbank exposures cannot be used. All unrated short-term exposures should receive the same risk weighting as that implied by the specific short-term rating.\n",

For example, exposures may be collateralized by first-priority claims, in whole or in part with cash or securities, a loan exposure may be guaranteed by a third party, or a bank may buy a credit derivative to offset various forms of credit risk.

      "9.5 | The effects of CRM must not be double-counted. Therefore, no additional supervisory recognition of CRM for regulatory capital purposes will be granted on exposures for which the risk weight already reflects that CRM. Consistent with paragraph 8.14 , principal-only ratings will also not be allowed within the CRM framework.\n",
      "9.6 | While the use of CRM techniques reduces or transfers credit risk, it may simultaneously increase other risks (i.e. residual risks). Residual risks include legal, operational, liquidity and market risks. Therefore, banks must employ robust procedures and processes to control these risks, including strategy; consideration of the underlying credit; valuation; policies and procedures; systems; control of roll-off risks; and management of concentration risk arising from the bank’s use of CRM techniques and its interaction with the bank’s overall credit risk profile. Where these risks are not adequately controlled, SAMA may impose additional capital charges or take other supervisory actions in the supervisory review process.\n",
      "9.7 | In order for CRM techniques to provide protection, the credit quality of the counterparty must not have a material positive correlation with the employed CRM technique or with the resulting residual risks (as defined in paragraph 9.6). For example, securities issued by the counterparty (or by any counterparty- related entity) provide little protection as collateral and are thus ineligible.\n",
      "9.8 | In the case where a bank has multiple CRM techniques covering a single exposure(e.g. a bank has both collateral and a guarantee partially covering an exposure), the bank must subdivide the exposure into portions covered by each type of CRM technique (e.g. portion covered by collateral, portion covered by guarantee) and the risk-weighted assets of each portion must be calculated separately. When credit protection provided by a single protection provider has differing maturities, they must be subdivided into separate protection as well.\n",
      "Legal requirements\n",
      "9.9 | In order for banks to obtain capital relief for any use of CRM techniques, all documentation used in collateralized transactions, on-balance sheet netting agreements, guarantees and credit derivatives must be binding on all parties and legally enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. Banks must have conducted sufficient legal review to verify this and have a well-founded legal basis to reach this conclusion, and undertake such further review as necessary to ensure continuing enforceability.\n",

      "General treatment of maturity mismatches | \n",
      "9.10 | For the purposes of calculating risk-weighted assets, a maturity mismatch occurs when the residual maturity of a credit protection arrangement (e.g. hedge) is less than that of the underlying exposure. | \n",
      "9.11 | In the case of financial collateral, maturity mismatches are not allowed under the simple approach (see paragraph 9.33 ). | \n",
      "9.12 | Under the other approaches, when there is a maturity mismatch the credit protection arrangement may only be recognized if the original maturity of the arrangement is greater than or equal to one year, and its residual maturity is greater than or equal to three months. In such cases, credit risk mitigation may be partially recognized as detailed below in paragraph 9.13. | \n",
      "9.13 | When there is a maturity mismatch with recognized credit risk mitigants, the following adjustment applies, where: | \n",
      " | (1) | P a = value of the credit protection adjusted for maturity mismatch\n",
      " | (2) | P = credit protection amount (e.g. collateral amount, guarantee amount)adjusted for any haircuts\n",
      " | (3) | t = min {T, residual maturity of the credit protection arrangement expressed in years}\n",
      " | (4) | T = min {five years, residual maturity of the exposure expressed in years}\n",
      " |  | \n",
      "9.14 | The maturity of the underlying exposure and the maturity of the hedge must both be defined conservatively. The effective maturity of the underlying must be gauged as the longest possible remaining time before the counterparty is scheduled to fulfil its obligation, taking into account any applicable grace period. For the hedge, (embedded) options that may reduce the term of the hedge must be taken into account so that the shortest possible effective maturity is used. For example: where, in the case of a credit derivative, the protection seller has a call option, the maturity is the first call date. Likewise, if the protection buyer owns the call option and has a strong incentive to call the transaction at the first call date, for example because of a step-up in cost from this date on, the effective maturity is the remaining time to the first call date. | \n",

Under the simple approach there is no specific treatment for currency mismatches, given that a minimum risk weight of 20% (floor) is generally applied.

      "9.22 | Where guarantees or credit derivatives fulfil the minimum operational conditions set out in paragraphs 9.69 to 9.71 , banks may take account of the credit protection offered by such credit risk mitigation techniques in calculating capital requirements.\n",
      "9.23 | A range of guarantors and protection providers are recognized and a substitution approach applies for capital requirement calculations. Only guarantees issued by or protection provided by entities with a lower risk weight than the counterparty lead to reduced capital charges for the guaranteed exposure, since the protected portion of the counterparty exposure is assigned the risk weight of the guarantor or protection provider, whereas the uncovered portion retains the risk weight of the underlying counterparty.\n",

Additionally, banks must take all steps necessary to fulfil those requirements under the law applicable to the bank’s interest in the collateral for obtaining and maintaining an enforceable security interest, e.g. by registering it with a registrar, or for exercising a right to net or set off in relation to the title transfer of the collateral.\n",

      "9.41 | The size of the haircuts that banks must use depends on the prescribed holding period for the transaction. For the purposes of chapter 9 ,the holding period is the period of time over which exposure or collateral values are assumed to move before the bank can close out the transaction. The supervisory prescribed minimum holding period is used as the basis for the calculation of the standard supervisory haircuts.\n",
      "9.42 | The holding period, and thus the size of the individual haircuts depends on the type of instrument, type of transaction, residual maturity and the frequency of marking to market and remargining as provided in paragraphs 9.49 to 9.50. For example, repo-style transactions subject to daily marking-to-market and to daily remargining will receive a haircut based on a 5-business day holding period and secured lending transactions with daily mark-to-market and no remargining clauses will receive a haircut based on a 20-business day holding period. Haircuts must be scaled up using the square root of time formula depending on the actual frequency of remargining or marking to market. This formula is included in paragraph 9.58.\n",
      "9.43 | Additionally, where the exposure and collateral are held in different currencies, banks must apply an additional haircut to the volatility-adjusted collateral amount in accordance with paragraphs 9.51 and 9.81 to 0 to take account of possible future fluctuations in exchange rates.\n",

The risk components include measures of the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), the exposure at default (EAD), and effective maturity (M). In some cases, banks may be required to use a supervisory value as opposed to an internal estimate for one or more of the risk components.\n",

In cases where an IRB treatment is not specified, the risk weight for those other exposures is 100%, except when a 0% risk weight applies under the standardized approach, and the resulting risk-weighted assets are assumed to represent UL only.

      "10.7 | In addition to general corporates, within the corporate asset class five sub-classes of specialized lending (SL) are identified. Such lending possesses all the following characteristics, in legal form or economic substance:\n",
      " | (1) | The exposure is typically to an entity (often a special purpose vehicle (SPV)) that was created specifically to finance and/or operate physical assets,\n",
      " | (2) | The borrowing entity has little or no other material assets or activities, and therefore little or no independent capacity to repay the obligation, apart from the income that it receives from the asset(s) being financed;\n",
      " | (3) | The terms of the obligation give the lender a substantial degree of control over the asset(s) and the income that it generates; and\n",
      " | (4) | As a result of the preceding factors, the primary source of repayment of the obligation is the income generated by the asset(s), rather than the independent capacity of a broader commercial enterprise.\n",
      "10.8 | The five sub-classes of SL are project finance (PF), object finance (OF), commodities finance (CF), income-producing real estate (IPRE) lending, and high-volatility commercial real estate (HVCRE) lending. Each of these subclasses is defined below.\n",
      "Project Finance\n",
      "10.9 | PF is a method of funding in which the lender looks primarily to the revenues generated by a single project, both as the source of repayment and as security for the exposure. This type of financing is usually for large, complex and expensive installations that might include, for example, power plants, chemical processing plants, mines, transportation infrastructure, environment, and telecommunications infrastructure. Project finance may take the form of financing of the construction of a new capital installation, or refinancing of an existing installation, with or without improvements.\n",
      "10.10 | In such transactions, the lender is usually paid solely or almost exclusively out of the money generated by the contracts for the facility’s output, such as the electricity sold by a power plant. The borrower is usually an SPV that is not permitted to perform any function other than developing, owning, and operating the installation. The consequence is that repayment depends primarily on the project’s cash flow and on the collateral value of the project’s assets. In contrast, if repayment of the exposure depends primarily on a well-established, diversified, credit-worthy, contractually obligated end user for repayment, it is considered a secured exposure to that end-user.\n",
      "Object Finance\n",
      "10.11 | OF refers to a method of funding the acquisition of physical assets (e.g. ships, aircraft, satellites, railcars, or fleets) where the repayment of the exposure is dependent on the cash flows generated by the specific assets that have been financed and pledged or assigned to the lender. A primary source of these cash flows might be rental or lease contracts with one or several third parties. In contrast, if the exposure is to a borrower whose financial condition and debt servicing capacity enables it to repay the debt without undue reliance on the specifically pledged assets, the exposure should be treated as a collateralized corporate exposure.\n",
      "Commodities Finance\n",
      "10.12 | CF refers to structured short-term lending to finance reserves, inventories, or receivables of exchange-traded commodities (e.g. crude oil, metals, or crops), where the exposure will be repaid from the proceeds of the sale of the commodity and the borrower has no independent capacity to repay the exposure. This is the case when the borrower has no other activities and no other material assets on its balance sheet. The structured nature of the financing is designed to compensate for the weak credit quality of the borrower. The exposure’s rating reflects its self-liquidating nature and the lender’s skill in structuring the transaction rather than the credit quality of the borrower.\n",
      "10.13 | Such lending can be distinguished from exposures financing the reserves, inventories, or receivables of other more diversified corporate borrowers. Banks are able to rate the credit quality of the latter type of borrowers based on their broader ongoing operations. In such cases, the value of the commodity serves as a risk mitigant rather than as the primary source of repayment.\n",
      "Income-Producing Real Estate Lending\n",
      "10.14 | IPRE lending refers to a method of providing funding to real estate (such as, office buildings to let, retail space, multifamily residential buildings, industrial or warehouse space, or hotels) where the prospects for repayment and recovery on the exposure depend primarily on the cash flows generated by the asset. The primary source of these cash flows would generally be lease or rental payments or the sale of the asset. The borrower may be, but is not required to be, an SPV, an operating company focused on real estate construction or holdings, or an operating company with sources of revenue other than real estate. The distinguishing characteristic of IPRE versus other corporate exposures that are collateralized by real estate is the strong positive correlation between the prospects for repayment of the exposure and the prospects for recovery in the event of default, with both depending primarily on the cash flows generated by a property.\n",
      "High-Volatility Commercial Real Estate Lending\n",
      "10.15 | HVCRE lending is the financing of commercial real estate that exhibits higher loss rate volatility (i.e. higher asset correlation) compared to other types of SL. HVCRE includes:\n",
      " | (1) | Commercial real estate exposures secured by properties of types that are categorized by SAMA as sharing higher volatilities in portfolio default rates;\n",
      " | (2) | Loans financing any of the land acquisition, development and construction (ADC) phases for properties of those types in such jurisdictions; and\n",
      " | (3) | Loans financing ADC of any other properties where the source of repayment at origination of the exposure is either the future uncertain sale of the property or cash flows whose source of repayment is substantially uncertain (e.g. the property has not yet been leased to the occupancy rate prevailing in that geographic market for that type of commercial real estate), unless the borrower has substantial equity at risk. Commercial ADC loans exempted from treatment as HVCRE loans on the basis of certainty of repayment or borrower equity are, however, ineligible for the additional reductions for SL exposures described in paragraph 13.4 .\n",

      "10.20 | The criteria related to the size of the pool of exposures are as follows:\n",
      " | (1) | The exposure must be one of a large pool of exposures, which are managed by the bank on a pooled basis.\n",
      " | (2) | Where a loan gives rise to a small business exposure below SAR 4 million, it may be treated as retail exposures if the bank treats such exposures in its internal risk management systems consistently over time and in the same manner as other retail exposures. This requires that such an exposure be originated in a similar manner to other retail exposures. Furthermore, it must not be managed individually in a way comparable to corporate exposures, but rather as part of a portfolio segment or pool of exposures with similar risk characteristics for purposes of risk assessment and quantification. However, this does not preclude retail exposures from being treated individually at some stages of the risk management process. The fact that an exposure is rated individually does not by itself deny the eligibility as a retail exposure.\n",

The use of the topdown purchased receivables treatment is limited to situations where it would be an undue burden on a bank to be subjected to the minimum requirements for the IRB approach to corporate exposures that would otherwise apply. Primarily, it is intended for receivables that are purchased for inclusion in asset-backed securitization structures, but banks may also use this approach, with the approval of SAMA, for appropriate on-balance sheet exposures that share the same features.\n",
      "10.28 | SAMA may deny the use of the top-down approach for purchased corporate receivables depending on the bank’s compliance with minimum requirements. In particular, to be eligible for the proposed ‘top-down’ treatment, purchased corporate receivables must satisfy the following conditions:\n",
      " | (1) | The receivables are purchased from unrelated, third party sellers, and as such the bank has not originated the receivables either directly or indirectly.\n",
      " | (2) | The receivables must be generated on an arm’s-length basis between the seller and the obligor. (As such, intercompany accounts receivable and receivables subject to contra-accounts between firms that buy and sell to each other are ineligible. 52 )\n",
      " | (3) | The purchasing bank has a claim on all proceeds from the pool of receivables or a pro-rata interest in the proceeds. 53\n",
      " | (4) | SAMA may establish concentration limits above which capital charges must be calculated using the minimum requirements for the bottom-up approach for corporate exposures.\n",
      "10.29 | The existence of full or partial recourse to the seller does not automatically disqualify a bank from adopting this top-down approach, as long as the cash flows from the purchased corporate receivables are the primary protection against default risk as determined by the rules in paragraphs 14.4 to 14.7 for purchased receivables and the bank meets the eligibility criteria and operational requirements.\n",
      "\n",
      "10.30 | For each of the asset classes covered under the IRB framework, there are three key elements:\n",
      " | (1) | Risk components: estimates of risk parameters provided by banks, some of which are supervisory estimates.\n",
      " | (2) | Risk-weight functions: the means by which risk components are transformed into risk-weighted assets and therefore capital requirements.\n",
      " | (3) | Minimum requirements: the minimum standards that must be met in order for a bank to use the IRB approach for a given asset class.\n",
      "10.31 | For certain asset classes, there are two broad approaches: a foundation and an advanced approach. Under the foundation approach (F-IRB approach), as a general rule, banks provide their own estimates of PD and rely on supervisory estimates for other risk components. Under the advanced approach (A-IRB approach), banks provide their own estimates of PD, LGD and EAD, and their own calculation of M, subject to meeting minimum standards. For both the foundation and advanced approaches, banks must always use the risk-weight functions provided in this Framework for the purpose of deriving capital requirements. The full suite of approaches is described below.\n",
      "10.32 | For exposures to equities, as defined in paragraph 10.24 , the IRB approaches are not permitted (see paragraph 10.41 ). In addition, the A-IRB approach cannot be used for the following:\n",

      " | (2) | Exposures in the bank asset class in paragraph 10.17 , and other securities firms and financial institutions (including insurance companies and any other financial institutions in the corporate asset class).\n",
      "10.33 | In making the assessment for the revenue threshold in paragraph 10.32, the amounts must be as reported in the audited financial statements of the corporates or, for corporates that are part of consolidated groups, their consolidated groups (according to the accounting standard applicable to the ultimate parent of the consolidated group). The figures must be based on the average amounts calculated over the prior three years, or on the latest amounts updated every three years by the bank.\n",
      "\n",
      "10.34 | Under the foundation approach, banks must provide their own estimates of PD associated with each of their borrower grades, but must use supervisory estimates for the other relevant risk components. The other risk components are LGD, EAD and M 54 .\n",
      "10.35 | Under the advanced approach, banks must calculate the effective maturity (M) 55 and provide their own estimates of PD, LGD and EAD.\n",

      "10.37 | Banks that do not meet the requirements for the estimation of PD under the corporate foundation approach for their SL exposures are required to map their internal risk grades to five supervisory categories, each of which is associated with a specific risk weight. This approach is termed the ‘supervisory slotting criteria approach’.\n",
      "10.38 | Banks that meet the requirements for the estimation of PD are able to use the foundation approach to corporate exposures to derive risk weights for all classes of SL exposures except HVCRE. SAMA may consider allowing banks meeting these requirements for HVCRE exposures to use a foundation approach that is similar in all respects to the corporate approach, with the exception of a separate risk-weight function as described in paragraph 11.11 .\n",

      "10.42 | The treatment potentially straddles two asset classes. For eligible corporate receivables, both a foundation and advanced approach are available subject to certain operational requirements being met. As noted in paragraph 10.27 , for corporate purchased receivables, banks are in general expected to assess the default risk of individual obligors. The bank may use the A-IRB treatment for purchased corporate receivables ( paragraphs 14.6 to 14.7 ) only for exposures to individual corporate obligors that are eligible for the A-IRB approach according to paragraphs 10.32 and 10.33 . Otherwise, the F-IRB treatment for purchased corporate receivables should be used. For eligible retail receivables, as with the retail asset class, only the A-IRB approach is available.\n",
      "\n",
      "10.43 | Once a bank adopts an IRB approach for part of its holdings within an asset class, it is expected to extend it across all holdings within that asset class. In this context, the relevant assets classes are as follows:\n",

      "10.44 | For many banks, it may not be practicable for various reasons to implement the IRB approach for an entire asset class across all business units at the same time. Furthermore, once on IRB, data limitations may mean that banks can meet the standards for the use of own estimates of LGD and EAD for some but not all of their exposures within an asset class at the same time (for example, exposures that are in the same asset class, but are in different business units).\n",
      "10.45 | As such, SAMA will consider allowing banks to adopt a phased rollout of the IRB approach across an asset class. The phased rollout includes: (i) adoption of IRB across the asset class within the same business unit; (ii) adoption of IRB for the asset class across business units in the same banking group; and (iii) move from the foundation approach to the advanced approach for certain risk components where use of the advanced approach is permitted. However, when a bank adopts an IRB approach for an asset class within a particular business unit, it must apply the IRB approach to all exposures within that asset class in that unit.\n",
      "10.46 | If a bank intends to adopt an IRB approach to an asset class, it must produce an implementation plan, specifying to what extent and when it intends to roll out the IRB approaches within the asset class and business units. The plan should be realistic, and must be agreed with the SAMA. It should be driven by the practicality and feasibility of moving to the more advanced approaches, and not motivated by a desire to adopt an approach that minimizes its capital charge. During the roll-out period, SAMA will ensure that no capital relief is granted for intra-group transactions which are designed to reduce a banking group’s aggregate capital charge by transferring credit risk among entities on the standardized approach, foundation and advanced IRB approaches. This includes, but is not limited to, asset sales or cross guarantees.\n",
      "10.47 | Some exposures that are immaterial in terms of size and perceived risk profile within their asset class may be exempt from the requirements in the previous two paragraphs, subject to supervisory approval. Capital requirements for such operations will be determined according to the standardized approach, SAMA will determine whether a bank should hold more capital under the supervisory review process for such positions.\n",
      "10.48 | Banks adopting an IRB approach for an asset class are expected to continue to employ an IRB approach for that asset class. A voluntary return to the standardized or foundation approach is permitted only in extraordinary circumstances, such as divestiture of a large fraction of the bank’s credit-related business in that asset class, and must be approved by SAMA\n",
      "10.49 | Given the data limitations associated with SL exposures, a bank may remain on the supervisory slotting criteria approach for one or more of the PF, OF, CF, IPRE or HVCRE sub-classes, and move to the foundation or advanced approach for the other sub-classes. However, a bank should not move to the advanced approach for the HVCRE sub-class without also doing so for material IPRE exposures at the same time.\n",

To adopt this treatment the collateral must be eligible under the F-IRB and the bank’s estimate of LGD U must not take account of any effects of collateral recoveries.\n",
      "12.19 | The minimum requirements for the derivation of LGD estimates are outlined in paragraphs 16.82 to 16.87 .\n",
      "Treatment of certain repo-style transactions\n",
      "12.20 | Banks that want to recognize the effects of master netting agreements on repo style transactions for capital purposes must apply the methodology outlined in paragraph 12.38 for determining E* for use as the EAD in the calculation of counterparty credit risk. For banks using the advanced approach, own LGD estimates would be permitted for the unsecured equivalent amount (E*) used to calculate counterparty credit risk. In both cases banks, in addition to counterparty credit risk, must also calculate the capital requirements relating to any credit or market risk to which they remain exposed arising from the underlying securities in the master netting agreement.\n",
      "Treatment of guarantees and credit derivatives\n",
      "12.21 | There are two approaches for recognition of credit risk mitigation (CRM) in the form of guarantees and credit derivatives in the IRB approach: a foundation approach for banks using supervisory values of LGD, and an advanced approach for those banks using their own internal estimates of LGD.\n",
      "12.22 | Under either approach, CRM in the form of guarantees and credit derivatives must not reflect the effect of double default (see paragraph 16.101 ). As such, to the extent that the CRM is recognized by the bank, the adjusted risk weight will not be less than that of a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider. Consistent with the standardized approach, banks may choose not to recognize credit protection if doing so would result in a higher capital requirement.\n",
      "Treatment of guarantees and credit derivatives: recognition under the foundation approach\n",
      "12.23 | For banks using the foundation approach for LGD, the approach to guarantees and credit derivatives closely follows the treatment under the standardized approach as specified in paragraphs 9.69 to 9.83 . The range of eligible guarantors is the same as under the standardized approach except that companies that are internally rated may also be recognized under the foundation approach. To receive recognition, the requirements outlined in paragraphs 9.69 to 9.74 of the standardized approach must be met.\n",
      "12.24 | Eligible guarantees from eligible guarantors will be recognized as follows:\n",
      " | (1) | For the covered portion of the exposure, a risk weight is derived by taking:\n",
      " |  | (a) | The risk-weight function appropriate to the type of guarantor, and\n",
      " |  | (b) | The pd appropriate to the guarantor’s borrower grade.\n",
      " | (2) | The bank may replace the LGD of the underlying transaction with the LGD applicable to the guarantee taking into account seniority and any collateralization of a guaranteed commitment. For example, when a bank has a subordinated claim on the borrower but the guarantee represents a senior claim on the guarantor this may be reflected by using an LGD applicable for senior exposures (see paragraph 12.6) instead of an LGD applicable for subordinated exposures.\n",
      " | (3) | In case the bank applies the standardized approach to direct exposures to the guarantor it may only recognize the guarantee by applying the standardized approach to the covered portion of the exposure.\n",
      "12.25 | The uncovered portion of the exposure is assigned the risk weight associated with the underlying obligor.\n",
      "12.26 | Where partial coverage exists, or where there is a currency mismatch between the underlying obligation and the credit protection, it is necessary to split the exposure into a covered and an uncovered amount. The treatment in the foundation approach follows that outlined in paragraphs 9.79 to 9.80 of the standardized approach, and depends upon whether the cover is proportional or tranched.\n",
      "Treatment of guarantees and credit derivatives: recognition under the advanced approach\n",
      "12.27 | Banks using the advanced approach for estimating LGDs may reflect the riskmitigating effect of guarantees and credit derivatives through either adjusting PD or LGD estimates. Whether adjustments are done through PD or LGD, they must be done in a consistent manner for a given guarantee or credit derivative type. In doing so, banks must not include the effect of double default in such adjustments. Thus, the adjusted risk weight must not be less than that of a comparable direct exposure to the protection provider. In case the bank applies the standardized approach to direct exposures to the guarantor it may only recognize the guarantee by applying the standardized approach to the covered portion of the exposure. In case the bank applies the F-IRB approach to direct exposures to the guarantor it may only recognize the guarantee by determining the risk weight for the comparable direct exposure to the guarantor according to the F-IRB approach.\n",
      "12.28 | A bank relying on own-estimates of LGD has the option to adopt the treatment outlined in paragraphs 12.23 to 12.26 above for banks under the F-IRB approach, or to make an adjustment to its LGD estimate of the exposure to reflect the presence of the guarantee or credit derivative. Under this option, there are no limits to the range of eligible guarantors although the set of minimum requirements provided in paragraphs 16.103 to 16.104 the type of guarantee must be satisfied. For credit derivatives, the requirements of paragraphs 16.109 to 16.110 must be satisfied 57 . For exposures for which a bank has permission to use its own estimates of LGD, the bank may recognize the risk mitigating effects of first-to-default credit derivatives, but may not recognize the risk mitigating effects of second-to-default or more generally nth-to-default credit derivatives.\n",

When only the drawn balances of revolving facilities have been securitized, banks must ensure that they continue to hold required capital against the undrawn balances associated with the securitized exposures.\n",
      "12.32 | In the foundation approach, EAD is calculated as the committed but undrawn amount multiplied by a credit conversion factor (CCF). In the advanced approach, EAD for undrawn commitments may be calculated as the committed but undrawn amount multiplied by a CCF or derived from direct estimates of total facility EAD. In both the foundation approach and advanced approaches, the definition of commitments is the same as in the standardized approach, as set out in paragraph 7.86 .\n",

If the facility is constrained in this way, the bank must have sufficient line monitoring and management procedures to support this contention.\n",
      "12.35 | Where a commitment is obtained on another off-balance sheet exposure, banks under the foundation approach are to apply the lower of the applicable CCFs.\n",
      "EAD under the advanced approach\n",
      "12.36 | Banks which meet the minimum requirements for use of their own estimates of EAD (see paragraphs 16.88 to 16.97 ) will be allowed for exposures for which A-IRB is permitted (see paragraph 10.31 ) to use their own internal estimates of EAD for undrawn revolving commitments 58 to extend credit, purchase assets or issue credit substitutes provided the exposure is not subject to a CCF of 100% in the foundation approach (see paragraph 12.33). Standardized approach CCFs must be used for all other off-balance sheet items (for example, undrawn nonrevolving commitments), and must be used where the minimum requirements for own estimates of EAD are not met. The EAD for each exposure that is not in the sovereign asset class that is used as input into the risk weight formula and the calculation of expected loss is subject to a floor that is the sum of: (i) the on balance sheet amount; and (ii) 50% of the off balance sheet exposure using the applicable CCF in the standardized approach.\n",
      "\n",
      "Exposures that give rise to counterparty credit risk\n",
      "12.37 | For exposures that give rise to counterparty credit risk according to The Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) Framework (i.e. OTC derivatives, exchange- traded derivatives, long settlement transactions and securities financing transactions (SFTs)), the EAD is to be calculated under the rules set in chapters 3 to 8 of the Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) framework .\n",
      "12.38 | For SFTs, banks may recognize a reduction in the counterparty credit risk requirement arising from the effect of a master netting agreement providing that it satisfy the criteria set out in paragraphs 9.61 and 9.62 of the standardized approach. The bank must calculate E*, which is the exposure to be used for the counterparty credit risk requirement taking account of the risk mitigation of collateral received, using the formula set out in paragraph 9.64 of the standardized approach. In calculating risk-weighted assets and expected loss (EL) amounts for the counterparty credit risk arising from the set of transactions covered by the master netting agreement, E* must be used as the EAD of the counterparty.\n",
      "12.39 | As an alternative to the use of standard haircuts for the calculation of the counterparty credit risk requirement for SFTs set out in paragraph 12.38, banks may be permitted to use a value-at-risk (VaR) models approach to reflect price volatility of the exposures and the financial collateral. This approach can take into account the correlation effects between security positions. This approach applies to single SFTs and SFTs covered by netting agreements on a counter party-by-counterparty basis, both under the condition that the collateral is revalued on a daily basis. This holds for the underlying securities being different and unrelated to securitizations. The master netting agreement must satisfy the criteria set out in paragraphs 9.61 and 9.62 of the standardized approach. The VaR models approach is available to banks that have received supervisory recognition for an internal market risk model according to paragraph 10.2 in The Market Risk Framework . Banks which have not received market risk model recognition can separately apply for supervisory recognition to use their internal VaR models for the calculation of potential price volatility for SFTs, provided the model meets the requirements of paragraph 10.2 in The Market Risk Framework . Although the market risk standards have changed from a 99% VaR to a 97.5% expected shortfall, the VaR models approach to SFTs retains the use of a 99% VaR to calculate the counterparty credit risk for SFTs. The VaR model needs to capture risk sufficient to pass the back testing and profit and loss attribution tests of paragraph 10.4 in The Market Risk Framework . The default risk charge of paragraphs 13.18 to 13.39 in The Market Risk Framework is not required in the VaR model for SFTs.\n",
      "12.40 | The quantitative and qualitative criteria for recognition of internal market risk models for SFTs are in principle the same as in paragraphs 10.5 to 10.16 and 13.1 to 13.12 in The Market Risk Framework . The minimum liquidity horizon or the holding period for SFTs is 5 business days for margined repo-style transactions, rather than the 10 business days in paragraph 13.12 in The Market Risk Framework . For other transactions eligible for the VaR models approach, the 10 business day holding period will be retained. The minimum holding period should be adjusted upwards for market instruments where such a holding period would be inappropriate given the liquidity of the instrument concerned.\n",
      "12.41 | The calculation of the exposure E* for banks using their internal model to calculate their counterparty credit risk requirement will be as follows, where banks will use the previous day's VaR number:\n",
      " | \n",
      "12.42 | Subject to SAMA’s approval, instead of using the VaR approach, banks may also calculate an effective expected positive exposure for repo-style and other similar SFTs, in accordance with the internal models method set out in the counterparty credit risk standards.\n",
      "12.43 | As in the standardized approach, for transactions where the conditions in paragraph 9.36 are met, and in addition, the counterparty is a core market participant as specified in paragraph 9.37 , banks can apply a zero H. A netting set that contains any transaction that does not meet the requirements in paragraph 9.36 of the standardized approach is not eligible for this treatment.\n",
      "Effective maturity (M)\n",
      "12.44 | Effective maturity (M) will be 2.5 years for exposures to which the bank applies the foundation approach, except for repo-style transactions where the effective maturity is 6 months (i.e. M=0.5). Banks using the foundation and advanced approaches are required to measure M for each facility using the definition provided below.\n",
      "12.45 | Banks using any element of the A-IRB approach are required to measure effective maturity for each facility as defined below.\n",
      "12.46 | Except as noted in paragraph 12.51, the effective maturity (M) is subject to a floor of one year and a cap of 5 years.\n",
      "12.47 | For an instrument subject to a determined cash flow schedule, effective maturity M is defined as follows, where CF t denotes the cash flows (principal, interest payments and fees) contractually payable by the borrower in period t:\n",
      " | \n",
      "12.48 | If a bank is not in a position to calculate the effective maturity of the contracted payments as noted above, it is allowed to use a more conservative measure of M such as that it equals the maximum remaining time (in years) that the borrower is permitted to take to fully discharge its contractual obligation (principal, interest, and fees) under the terms of loan agreement. Normally, this will correspond to the nominal maturity of the instrument.\n",
      "12.49 | For derivatives subject to a master netting agreement, the effective maturity is defined as the weighted average maturity of the transactions within the netting agreement. Further, the notional amount of each transaction should be used for weighting the maturity.\n",
      "12.50 | For revolving exposures, effective maturity must be determined using the maximum contractual termination date of the facility. Banks must not use the repayment date of the current drawing.\n",
      "12.51 | The one-year floor, set out in paragraph 12.46 above, does not apply to certain short- term exposures, comprising fully or nearly-fully collateralized 59 capital market- driven transactions (i.e. OTC derivatives transactions and margin lending) and repo- style transactions (i.e. repos/reverse repos and securities lending/borrowing) with an original maturity of less than one year, where the documentation contains daily re-margining clauses. For all eligible transactions the documentation must require daily revaluation, and must include provisions that must allow for the prompt liquidation or setoff of the collateral in the event of default or failure to re-margin. The maturity of such transactions must be calculated as the greater of one-day, and the effective maturity (M, consistent with the definition above), except for transactions subject to a master netting agreement, where the floor is determined by the minimum holding period for the transaction type, as required by paragraph 12.54.\n",
      "12.52 | The one-year floor, set out in paragraph 12.46 above, also does not apply to the following exposures:\n",
      " | (1) | Short-term self-liquidating trade transactions. Import and export letters of credit and similar transactions should be accounted for at their actual remaining maturity.\n",
      " | (2) | Issued as well as confirmed letters of credit that are short term (i.e. have a maturity below one year) and self-liquidating.\n",
      "12.53 | In addition to the transactions considered in paragraph 12.51 above, other short term exposures with an original maturity of less than one year that are not part of a bank’s ongoing financing of an obligor may be eligible for exemption from the one-year floor. After a careful review of the particular circumstances, SAMA will define the types of short-term exposures that might be considered eligible for this treatment. The results of these reviews might, for example, include transactions such as:\n",
      " | (1) | Some capital market-driven transactions and repo-style transactions that might not fall within the scope of paragraph 12.51.\n",
      " | (2) | Some trade finance transactions that are not exempted by paragraph 12.52.\n",
      " | (3) | Some exposures arising from settling securities purchases and sales. This could also include overdrafts arising from failed securities settlements provided that such overdrafts do not continue more than a short, fixed number of business days.\n",

      " | (6) | Some short-term loans and deposits.\n",
      "12.54 | For transactions falling within the scope of paragraph 12.51 subject to a master netting agreement, the effective maturity is defined as the weighted average maturity of the transactions. A floor equal to the minimum holding period for the transaction type set out in paragraph 9.56 of the standardized approach will apply to the average. Where more than one transaction type is contained in the master netting agreement a floor equal to the highest holding period will apply to the average. Further, the notional amount of each transaction should be used for weighting maturity.\n",

Whether adjustments are done through PD or LGD, they must be done in a consistent manner for a given guarantee or credit derivative type. In case the bank applies the standardized approach to direct exposures to the guarantor it may only recognize the guarantee by applying the standardized approach risk weight to the covered portion of the exposure.\n",

When the difference between the instrument’s EAD and the sum of (i) and (ii) is positive, this amount is termed a discount. The calculation of risk-weighted assets is independent of any discounts. Under the limited circumstances described in paragraph 15.4 , discounts may be included in the measurement of total eligible provisions for purposes of the EL-provision calculation set out in chapter 15 .\n",

Banks must use their own estimates of EAD for undrawn revolving commitments to extend credit, purchase assets or issue credit substitutes provided the exposure is not subject to a CCF of 100% in the standardized approach (see paragraph 7.84 ) and the minimum requirements in paragraphs 16.88 to 16.98 are satisfied.

      "12.65 | For retail exposures with uncertain future drawdown such as credit cards, banks must take into account their history and/or expectation of additional drawings prior to default in their overall calibration of loss estimates. In particular, where a bank does not reflect conversion factors for undrawn lines in its EAD estimates, it must reflect in its LGD estimates the likelihood of additional drawings prior to default. Conversely, if the bank does not incorporate the possibility of additional drawings in its LGD estimates, it must do so in its EAD estimates.\n",

      "14.2 | For receivables belonging unambiguously to one asset class, the IRB risk weight for default risk is based on the risk-weight function applicable to that particular exposure type, as long as the bank can meet the qualification standards for this particular risk-weight function. For example, if banks cannot comply with the standards for qualifying revolving retail exposures (defined in paragraph 10.22 ), they should use the risk-weight function for other retail exposures. For hybrid pools containing mixtures of exposure types, if the purchasing bank cannot separate the exposures by type, the risk-weight function producing the highest capital requirements for the exposure types in the receivable pool applies.\n",
      "14.3 | For purchased retail receivables, a bank must meet the risk quantification standards for retail exposures but can utilize external and internal reference data to estimate the probabilities of default (PDs) and losses-given-default (LGDs). The estimates for PD and LGD (or expected loss, EL) must be calculated for the receivables on a stand-alone basis; that is, without regard to any assumption of recourse or guarantees from the seller or other parties.\n",
      "14.4 | For purchased corporate receivables the purchasing bank is expected to apply the existing IRB risk quantification standards for the bottom-up approach. However, for eligible purchased corporate receivables, and subject to supervisory permission, a bank may employ the following top-down procedure for calculating IRB risk weights for default risk:\n",
      " | (1) | The purchasing bank will estimate the pool’s one-year EL for default risk, expressed in percentage of the exposure amount (i.e. the total exposure-at-default, or EAD, amount to the bank by all obligors in the receivables pool). The estimated EL must be calculated for the receivables on a stand-alone basis; that is, without regard to any assumption of recourse or guarantees from the seller or other parties. The treatment of recourse or guarantees covering default risk (and/or dilution risk) is discussed separately below.\n",
      " | (2) | Given the EL estimate for the pool’s default losses, the risk weight for default risk is determined by the risk-weight function for corporate exposures 60 . As described below, the precise calculation of risk weights for default risk depends on the bank’s ability to decompose EL into its PD and LGD components in a reliable manner. Banks can utilize external and internal data to estimate PDs and LGDs. However, the advanced approach will not be available for banks that use the foundation approach for corporate exposures.\n",

      "14.6 | Under the advanced IRB approach, if the purchasing bank can estimate either the pool’s default-weighted average loss rates given default (as defined in paragraph 16.82 ) or average PD in a reliable manner, the bank may estimate the other parameter based on an estimate of the expected long-run loss rate. The bank may: (i) use an appropriate PD estimate to infer the long-run default- weighted average loss rate given default; or (ii) use a long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default to infer the appropriate PD. In either case, the LGD used for the IRB capital calculation for purchased receivables cannot be less than the long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default and must be consistent with the concepts defined in paragraph 16.82 . The risk weight for the purchased receivables will be determined using the bank’s estimated PD and LGD as inputs to the corporate risk-weight function. Similar to the foundation IRB treatment, EAD will be the amount outstanding minus K Dilution . EAD for a revolving purchase facility will be the sum of the current amount of receivables purchased plus 40% of any undrawn purchase commitments minus K Dilution (thus, banks using the advanced IRB approach will not be permitted to use their internal EAD estimates for undrawn purchase commitments).\n",
      "14.7 | For drawn amounts, M will equal the pool’s exposure-weighted average effective maturity (as defined in paragraphs 12.44 to 12.55 ). This same value of M will also be used for undrawn amounts under a committed purchase facility provided the facility contains effective covenants, early amortization triggers, or other features that protect the purchasing bank against a significant deterioration in the quality of the future receivables it is required to purchase over the facility’s term. Absent such effective protections, the M for undrawn amounts will be calculated as the sum of: (a) the longest-dated potential receivable under the purchase agreement;and (b) the remaining maturity of the purchase facility.\n",
      "\n",
      "14.8 | Dilution refers to the possibility that the receivable amount is reduced through cash or non-cash credits to the receivable’s obligor 61 . For both corporate and retail receivables, unless the bank can demonstrate to its supervisor that the dilution risk for the purchasing bank is immaterial, the treatment of dilution risk must be the following:\n",
      " | (1) | At the level of either the pool as a whole (top-down approach) or the individual receivables making up the pool (bottom-up approach), the purchasing bank will estimate the one-year EL for dilution risk, also expressed in percentage of the receivables amount. Banks can utilize external and internal data to estimate EL. As with the treatments of default risk, this estimate must be computed on a stand-alone basis; that is, under the assumption of no recourse or other support from the seller or third-party guarantors.\n",
      " | (2) | For the purpose of calculating risk weights for dilution risk, the corporate risk-weight function must be used with the following settings:\n",
      " |  | (a) | The PD must be set equal to the estimated EL.\n",
      " |  | (b) | The LGD must be set at 100%.\n",
      " |  | (c) | An appropriate maturity treatment applies when determining the capital requirement for dilution risk. If a bank can demonstrate that the dilution risk is appropriately monitored and managed to be resolved within one year, the supervisor may allow the bank to apply a one-year maturity.\n",
      "14.9 | This treatment will be applied regardless of whether the underlying receivables are corporate or retail exposures, and regardless of whether the risk weights for default risk are computed using the standard IRB treatments or, for corporate receivables, the top-down treatment described above.\n",
      "\n",
      "14.10 | In many cases, the purchase price of receivables will reflect a discount (not to be confused with the discount concept defined in paragraphs 12.29 and 12.62 ) that provides first loss protection for default losses, dilution losses or both. To the extent that a portion of such a purchase price discount may be refunded to the seller based on the performance of the receivables, the purchaser may recognize this refundable amount as first-loss protection and hence treat this exposure under the securitization chapters 18 to 23 , while the seller providing such a refundable purchase price discount must treat the refundable amount as a first-loss position under the securitization chapters. Non-refundable purchase price discounts for receivables do not affect either the EL-provision calculation in chapter 15 or the calculation of risk-weighted assets.\n",
      "14.11 | When collateral or partial guarantees obtained on receivables provide first loss protection (collectively referred to as mitigants in this paragraph), and these mitigants cover default losses, dilution losses, or both, they may also be treated as first loss protection under the securitization chapters (see paragraph 22.10 ). When the same mitigant covers both default and dilution risk, banks using the Securitization Internal Ratings-Based Approach (SEC-IRBA) that are able to calculate an exposure-weighted LGD must do so as defined in paragraph 22.21 .\n",
      "\n",
      "14.12 | Credit risk mitigants will be recognized generally using the same type of framework as set forth in paragraphs 12.21 to 12.28 62 .In particular, a guarantee provided by the seller or a third party will be treated using the existing IRB rules for guarantees, regardless of whether the guarantee covers default risk, dilution risk, or both.\n",
      " | (1) | If the guarantee covers both the pool’s default risk and dilution risk, the bank will substitute the risk weight for an exposure to the guarantor in place of the pool’s total risk weight for default and dilution risk.\n",

The capital requirement for the other component will then be added.\n",
      " | (3) | If a guarantee covers only a portion of the default and/or dilution risk, the uncovered portion of the default and/or dilution risk will be treated as per the existing credit risk mitigation rules for proportional or tranched coverage (i.e. the risk weights of the uncovered risk components will be added to the risk weights of the covered risk components)\n",

For corporate, sovereign, bank, and retail exposures that are in default, banks must use their best estimate of expected loss as defined in paragraph 16.85 for exposures subject to the advanced approach and for exposures subject to the foundation approach banks must use the supervisory LGD. For exposures subject to the supervisory slotting criteria EL is calculated as described in the chapter on the supervisory slotting approach ( paragraphs 13.8 to 13.12 ). Securitization exposures do not contribute to the EL amount, as set out in in paragraph 18.36 .\n",

      "15.6 | Banks should generally attribute total general provisions on a pro rata basis according to the proportion of credit risk-weighted assets subject to the standardized and IRB approaches. However, when one approach to determining credit risk-weighted assets (i.e. standardized or IRB approach) is used exclusively within an entity, general provisions booked within the entity using the standardized approach may be attributed to the standardized treatment. Similarly, general provisions booked within entities using the IRB approach may be attributed to the total eligible provisions as defined in paragraph 15.4.\n",
      "15.7 | At SAMA’s discretion, banks using both the standardized and IRB approaches may rely on their internal methods for allocating general provisions for recognition in capital under either the standardized or IRB approach, subject to the following conditions. Where the internal allocation method is made available, the national supervisor will establish the standards surrounding their use. Banks will need to obtain prior approval from their SAMA to use an internal allocation method for this purpose.\n",

In addition, article 2.2.3 in the aforementioned rules outlines the treatment for that portion of a bank that is subject to the standardized approach for credit risk when the bank uses both the standardized and IRB approaches.\n",
      "15.9 | Where the calculated EL amount is lower than the total eligible provisions of the bank, SAMA will consider whether the EL fully reflects the conditions in the market in which it operates before allowing the difference to be included in Tier 2 capital.

      "\n",
      "16.3 | To be eligible for the IRB approach a bank must demonstrate to SAMA that it meets certain minimum requirements at the outset and on an ongoing basis. Many of these requirements are in the form of objectives that a qualifying bank’s risk rating systems must fulfil. The focus is on banks’ abilities to rank order and quantify risk in a consistent, reliable and valid fashion.\n",
      "16.4 | The overarching principle behind these requirements is that rating and risk estimation systems and processes provide for a meaningful assessment of borrower and transaction characteristics; a meaningful differentiation of risk; and reasonably accurate and consistent quantitative estimates of risk. Furthermore, the systems and processes must be consistent with internal use of these estimates.\n",
      "16.5 | The minimum requirements set out in this chapter apply to all asset classes unless noted otherwise. The standards related to the process of assigning exposures to borrower or facility grades (and the related oversight, validation, etc.) apply equally to the process of assigning retail exposures to pools of homogenous exposures, unless noted otherwise.\n",
      "16.6 | The minimum requirements set out in this chapter apply to both foundation and advanced approaches unless noted otherwise. Generally, all IRB banks must produce their own estimates of probability of default (PD 63 ) and must adhere to the overall requirements for rating system design, operations, controls, and corporate governance, as well as the requisite requirements for estimation and validation of PD measures. Banks wishing to use their own estimates of LGD and EAD must also meet the incremental minimum requirements for these risk factors included in paragraphs 16.82 to 16.110 .\n",

      "16.7 | To be eligible for an IRB approach, a bank must demonstrate to SAMA that it meets the IRB requirements in this framework, at the outset and on an ongoing basis. Banks’ overall credit risk management practices must also be consistent with the evolving sound practice/guidelines issued by SAMA.\n",
      "16.8 | There may be circumstances when a bank is not in complete compliance with all the minimum requirements. Where this is the case, the bank must produce a plan for a timely return to compliance, and seek approval from its supervisor, or the bank must demonstrate that the effect of such noncompliance is immaterial in terms of the risk posed to the institution. Failure to produce an acceptable plan or satisfactorily implement the plan or to demonstrate immateriality will lead SAMA to reconsider the bank’s eligibility for the IRB approach. Furthermore, for the duration of any noncompliance, SAMA will consider the need for the bank to hold additional capital under the supervisory review process or take other appropriate supervisory action.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.9 | The term “rating system” comprises all of the methods, processes, controls, and data collection and IT systems that support the assessment of credit risk, the assignment of internal risk ratings, and the quantification of default and loss estimates.\n",
      "16.10 | Within each asset class, a bank may utilize multiple rating methodologies /systems. For example, a bank may have customized rating systems for specific industries or market segments (e.g. middle market, and large corporate). If a bank chooses to use multiple systems, the rationale for assigning a borrower to a rating system must be documented and applied in a manner that best reflects the level of risk of the borrower. Banks must not allocate borrowers across rating systems inappropriately to minimize regulatory capital requirements (i.e. cherry- picking by choice of rating system). Banks must demonstrate that each system used for IRB purposes is in compliance with the minimum requirements at the outset and on an ongoing basis.\n",
      "Rating dimensions: standards for corporate, sovereign and bank exposures\n",
      "16.11 | A qualifying IRB rating system must have two separate and distinct dimensions:\n",
      " | (1) | the risk of borrower default; and\n",
      " | (2) | transaction-specific factors.\n",
      "16.12 | The first dimension must be oriented to the risk of borrower default. Separate exposures to the same borrower must be assigned to the same borrower grade, irrespective of any differences in the nature of each specific transaction. There are two exceptions to this. Firstly, in the case of country transfer risk, where a bank may assign different borrower grades depending on whether the facility is denominated in local or foreign currency. Secondly, when the treatment of associated guarantees to a facility may be reflected in an adjusted borrower grade. In either case, separate exposures may result in multiple grades for the same borrower. A bank must articulate in its credit policy the relationship between borrower grades in terms of the level of risk each grade implies. Perceived and measured risk must increase as credit quality declines from one grade to the next. The policy must articulate the risk of each grade in terms of both a description of the probability of default risk typical for borrowers assigned the grade and the criteria used to distinguish that level of credit risk.\n",
      "16.13 | The second dimension must reflect transaction-specific factors, such as collateral, seniority, product type, etc. For exposures subject to the foundation IRB approach, this requirement can be fulfilled by the existence of a facility dimension, which reflects both borrower and transaction-specific factors. For example, a rating dimension that reflects expected loss (EL) by incorporating both borrower strength (PD) and loss severity (LGD) considerations would qualify. Likewise a rating system that exclusively reflects LGD would qualify. Where a rating dimension reflects EL and does not separately quantify LGD, the supervisory estimates of LGD must be used.\n",
      "16.14 | For banks using the advanced approach, facility ratings must reflect exclusively LGD. These ratings can reflect any and all factors that can influence LGD including, but not limited to, the type of collateral, product, industry, and purpose. Borrower characteristics may be included as LGD rating criteria only to the extent they are predictive of LGD. Banks may alter the factors that influence facility grades across segments of the portfolio as long as they can satisfy their supervisor that it improves the relevance and precision of their estimates.\n",
      "16.15 | Banks using the supervisory slotting criteria are exempt from this two dimensional requirement for these exposures. Given the interdependence between borrower/transaction characteristics in exposures subject to the supervisory slotting approaches, banks may satisfy the requirements under this heading through a single rating dimension that reflects EL by incorporating both borrower strength (PD) and loss severity (LGD) considerations. This exemption does not apply to banks using the general corporate foundation or advanced approach for the specialized lending (SL) sub-class.\n",
      "Rating dimensions: standards for retail exposures\n",
      "16.16 | Rating systems for retail exposures must be oriented to both borrower and transaction risk, and must capture all relevant borrower and transaction characteristics. Banks must assign each exposure that falls within the definition of retail for IRB purposes into a particular pool. Banks must demonstrate that this process provides for a meaningful differentiation of risk, provides for a grouping of sufficiently homogenous exposures, and allows for accurate and consistent estimation of loss characteristics at pool level.\n",
      "16.17 | For each pool, banks must estimate PD, LGD, and EAD. Multiple pools may share identical PD, LGD and EAD estimates. At a minimum, banks should consider the following risk drivers when assigning exposures to a pool:\n",
      " | (1) | Borrower risk characteristics (e.g. borrower type, demographics such as age /occupation).\n",
      " | (2) | Transaction risk characteristics, including product and/or collateral types (e.g. loan to value measures, seasoning 64 , guarantees; and seniority (first vs. second lien)). Banks must explicitly address cross collateral provisions where present.\n",

      "16.19 | To meet this objective, a bank must have a minimum of seven borrower grades for non-defaulted borrowers and one for those that have defaulted. Banks with lending activities focused on a particular market segment may satisfy this requirement with the minimum number of grades.\n",
      "16.20 | A borrower grade is defined as an assessment of borrower risk on the basis of a specified and distinct set of rating criteria, from which estimates of PD are derived. The grade definition must include both a description of the degree of default risk typical for borrowers assigned the grade and the criteria used to distinguish that level of credit risk. Furthermore, “+” or “-” modifiers to alpha or numeric grades will only qualify as distinct grades if the bank has developed complete rating descriptions and criteria for their assignment, and separately quantifies PDs for these modified grades.\n",
      "16.21 | Banks with loan portfolios concentrated in a particular market segment and range of default risk must have enough grades within that range to avoid undue concentrations of borrowers in particular grades. Significant concentrations within a single grade or grades must be supported by convincing empirical evidence that the grade or grades cover reasonably narrow PD bands and that the default risk posed by all borrowers in a grade fall within that band.\n",
      "16.22 | There is no specific minimum number of facility grades for banks using the advanced approach for estimating LGD. A bank must have a sufficient number of facility grades to avoid grouping facilities with widely varying LGDs into a single grade. The criteria used to define facility grades must be grounded in empirical evidence.\n",
      "16.23 | Banks using the supervisory slotting criteria must have at least four grades for non-defaulted borrowers, and one for defaulted borrowers. The requirements for SL exposures that qualify for the corporate foundation and advanced approaches are the same as those for general corporate exposures.\n",
      "Rating structure: standards for retail exposures\n",
      "16.24 | For each pool identified, the bank must be able to provide quantitative measures of loss characteristics (PD, LGD, and EAD) for that pool. The level of differentiation for IRB purposes must ensure that the number of exposures in a given pool is sufficient so as to allow for meaningful quantification and validation of the loss characteristics at the pool level. There must be a meaningful distribution of borrowers and exposures across pools. A single pool must not include an undue concentration of the bank’s total retail exposure.\n",
      "Rating criteria\n",
      "16.25 | A bank must have specific rating definitions, processes and criteria for assigning exposures to grades within a rating system. The rating definitions and criteria must be both plausible and intuitive and must result in a meaningful differentiation of risk.\n",
      " | (1) | The grade descriptions and criteria must be sufficiently detailed to allow those charged with assigning ratings to consistently assign the same grade to borrowers or facilities posing similar risk. This consistency should exist across lines of business, departments and geographic locations. If rating criteria and procedures differ for different types of borrowers or facilities, the bank must monitor for possible inconsistency, and must alter rating criteria to improve consistency when appropriate.\n",
      " | (2) | Written rating definitions must be clear and detailed enough to allow third parties to understand the assignment of ratings, such as internal audit or an equally independent function and supervisors, to replicate rating assignments and evaluate the appropriateness of the grade/pool assignments.\n",
      " | (3) | The criteria must also be consistent with the bank’s internal lending standards and its policies for handling troubled borrowers and facilities.\n",
      "16.26 | To ensure that banks are consistently taking into account available information, they must use all relevant and material information in assigning ratings to borrowers and facilities. Information must be current. The less information a bank has, the more conservative must be its assignments of exposures to borrower and facility grades or pools. An external rating can be the primary factor determining an internal rating assignment; however, the bank must ensure that it considers other relevant information.\n",
      "Rating criteria: exposures subject to the supervisory slotting approach\n",
      "16.27 | Banks using the supervisory slotting criteria must assign exposures to their internal rating grades based on their own criteria, systems and processes, subject to compliance with the requisite minimum requirements. Banks must then map these internal rating grades into the five supervisory rating categories. The slotting criteria tables in the supervisory slotting approach chapter 13 provide, for each sub-class of SL exposures, the general assessment factors and characteristics exhibited by the exposures that fall under each of the supervisory categories. Each lending activity has a unique table describing the assessment factors and characteristics.\n",
      "16.28 | The criteria that banks use to assign exposures to internal grades will not perfectly align with criteria that define the supervisory categories; however, banks must demonstrate that their mapping process has resulted in an alignment of grades which is consistent with the preponderance of the characteristics in the respective supervisory category. Banks should take special care to ensure that any over rides of their internal criteria do not render the mapping process ineffective.\n",
      "Rating assignment horizon\n",
      "16.29 | Although the time horizon used in PD estimation is one year (as described in paragraph 16.62 ), banks are expected to use a longer time horizon in assigning ratings.\n",
      "16.30 | A borrower rating must represent the bank’s assessment of the borrower’s ability and willingness to contractually perform despite adverse economic conditions or the occurrence of unexpected events. The range of economic conditions that are considered when making assessments must be consistent with current conditions and those that are likely to occur over a business cycle within the respective industry/geographic region. Rating systems should be designed in such a way that idiosyncratic or industry-specific changes are a driver of migrations from one category to another, and business cycle effects may also be a driver.\n",
      "16.31 | PD estimates for borrowers that are highly leveraged or for borrowers whose assets are predominantly traded assets must reflect the performance of the underlying assets based on periods of stressed volatilities.\n",
      "16.32 | Given the difficulties in forecasting future events and the influence they will have on a particular borrower’s financial condition, a bank must take a conservative view of projected information. Furthermore, where limited data are available, a bank must adopt a conservative bias to its analysis.\n",
      "Use of models\n",
      "16.33 | The requirements in this section apply to statistical models and other mechanical methods used to assign borrower or facility ratings or in estimation of PDs, LGDs, or EADs. Credit scoring models and other mechanical rating procedures generally use only a subset of available information. Although mechanical rating procedures may sometimes avoid some of the idiosyncratic errors made by rating systems in which human judgement plays a large role, mechanical use of limited information also is a source of rating errors. Credit scoring models and other mechanical procedures are permissible as the primary or partial basis of rating assignments, and may play a role in the estimation of loss characteristics. Sufficient human judgement and human oversight is necessary to ensure that all relevant and material information, including that which is outside the scope of the model, is also taken into consideration, and that the model is used appropriately.\n",
      " | (1) | The burden is on the bank to satisfy its supervisor that a model or procedure has good predictive power and that regulatory capital requirements will not be distorted as a result of its use. The variables that are input to the model must form a reasonable set of predictors. The model must be accurate on average across the range of borrowers or facilities to which the bank is exposed and there must be no known material biases.\n",
      " | (2) | The bank must have in place a process for vetting data inputs into a statistical default or loss prediction model which includes an assessment of the accuracy, completeness and appropriateness of the data specific to the assignment of an approved rating.\n",
      " | (3) | The bank must demonstrate that the data used to build the model are representative of the population of the bank’s actual borrowers or facilities.\n",
      " | (4) | When combining model results with human judgement, the judgement must take into account all relevant and material information not considered by the model. The bank must have written guidance describing how human judgement and model results are to be combined.\n",
      " | (5) | The bank must have procedures for human review of model-based rating assignments. Such procedures should focus on finding and limiting errors associated with known model weaknesses and must also include credible ongoing efforts to improve the model’s performance.\n",
      " | (6) | The bank must have a regular cycle of model validation that includes monitoring of model performance and stability; review of model relationships; and testing of model outputs against outcomes.\n",
      "Documentation of rating system design\n",
      "16.34 | Banks must document in writing their rating systems’ design and operational details. The documentation must evidence banks’ compliance with the minimum standards, and must address topics such as portfolio differentiation, rating criteria, responsibilities of parties that rate borrowers and facilities, definition of what constitutes a rating exception, parties that have authority to approve exceptions, frequency of rating reviews, and management oversight of the rating process. A bank must document the rationale for its choice of internal rating criteria and must be able to provide analyses demonstrating that rating criteria and procedures are likely to result in ratings that meaningfully differentiate risk. Rating criteria and procedures must be periodically reviewed to determine whether they remain fully applicable to the current portfolio and to external conditions. In addition, a bank must document a history of major changes in the risk rating process, and such documentation must support identification of changes made to the risk rating process subsequent to the last supervisory review. The organization of rating assignment, including the internal control structure, must also be documented.\n",
      "16.35 | Banks must document the specific definitions of default and loss used internally and demonstrate consistency with the reference definitions set out in paragraphs 16.67 to 16.75 .\n",
      "16.36 | If the bank employs statistical models in the rating process, the bank must document their methodologies. This material must:\n",
      " | (1) | Provide a detailed outline of the theory, assumptions and/or mathematical and empirical basis of the assignment of estimates to grades, individual obligors, exposures, or pools, and the data source(s) used to estimate the model;\n",
      " | (2) | Establish a rigorous statistical process (including out-of-time and out- of-sample performance tests) for validating the model; and\n",
      " | (3) | Indicate any circumstances under which the model does not work effectively.\n",
      "16.37 | Use of a model obtained from a third-party vendor that claims proprietary technology is not a justification for exemption from documentation or any other of the requirements for internal rating systems. The burden is on the model’s vendor and the bank to satisfy SAMA.\n",
      "\n",
      "Coverage of ratings\n",
      "16.38 | For corporate, sovereign and bank exposures, each borrower and all recognized guarantors must be assigned a rating and each exposure must be associated with a facility rating as part of the loan approval process. Similarly, for retail, each exposure must be assigned to a pool as part of the loan approval process.\n",
      "16.39 | Each separate legal entity to which the bank is exposed must be separately rated. A bank must have policies acceptable to its supervisor regarding the treatment of individual entities in a connected group including circumstances under which the same rating may or may not be assigned to some or all related entities. Those policies must include a process for the identification of specific wrong way risk for each legal entity to which the bank is exposed. Transactions with counterparties where specific wrong way risk has been identified need to be treated differently when calculating the EAD for such exposures (see paragraph 7.48 in the CCR framework ).\n",
      "Integrity of rating process: standards for corporate, sovereign and bank exposures\n",
      "16.40 | Rating assignments and periodic rating reviews must be completed or approved by a party that does not directly stand to benefit from the extension of credit. Independence of the rating assignment process can be achieved through a range of practices that will be carefully reviewed by SAMA. These operational processes must be documented in the bank’s procedures and incorporated into bank policies. Credit policies and underwriting procedures must reinforce and foster the independence of the rating process.\n",
      "16.41 | Borrowers and facilities must have their ratings refreshed at least on an annual basis. Certain credits, especially higher risk borrowers or problem exposures, must be subject to more frequent review. In addition, banks must initiate a new rating if material information on the borrower or facility comes to light.\n",
      "16.42 | The bank must have an effective process to obtain and update relevant and material information on the borrower’s financial condition, and on facility characteristics that affect LGDs and EADs (such as the condition of collateral). Upon receipt, the bank needs to have a procedure to update the borrower’s rating in a timely fashion.\n",
      "Integrity of rating process: standards for retail exposures\n",
      "16.43 | A bank must review the loss characteristics and delinquency status of each identified risk pool on at least an annual basis. It must also review the status of individual borrowers within each pool as a means of ensuring that exposures continue to be assigned to the correct pool. This requirement may be satisfied by review of a representative sample of exposures in the pool.\n",
      "Overrides\n",
      "16.44 | For rating assignments based on expert judgement, banks must clearly articulate the situations in which bank officers may override the outputs of the rating process, including how and to what extent such overrides can be used and by whom. For model-based ratings, the bank must have guidelines and processes for monitoring cases where human judgement has overridden the model’s rating, variables were excluded or inputs were altered. These guidelines must include identifying personnel that are responsible for approving these overrides. Banks must identify overrides and separately track their performance.\n",
      "Data maintenance\n",
      "16.45 | A bank must collect and store data on key borrower and facility characteristics to provide effective support to its internal credit risk measurement and management process, to enable the bank to meet the other requirements in this document, and to serve as a basis for supervisory reporting. These data should be sufficiently detailed to allow retrospective re-allocation of obligors and facilities to grades, for example if increasing sophistication of the internal rating system suggests that finer segregation of portfolios can be achieved. Furthermore, banks must collect and retain data on aspects of their internal ratings as required by Pillar 3 Disclosure Requirements Framework .\n",
      "Data maintenance: for corporate, sovereign and bank exposures\n",
      "16.46 | Banks must maintain rating histories on borrowers and recognized guarantors, including the rating since the borrower/guarantor was assigned an internal grade, the dates the ratings were assigned, the methodology and key data used to derive the rating and the person/model responsible. The identity of borrowers and facilities that default, and the timing and circumstances of such defaults, must be retained. Banks must also retain data on the PDs and realized default rates associated with rating grades and ratings migration in order to track the predictive power of the borrower rating system.\n",
      "16.47 | Banks using the advanced IRB approach must also collect and store a complete history of data on the LGD and EAD estimates associated with each facility and the key data used to derive the estimate and the person/model responsible. Banks must also collect data on the estimated and realized LGDs and EADs associated with each defaulted facility. Banks that reflect the credit risk mitigating effects of guarantees/credit derivatives through LGD must retain data on the LGD of the facility before and after evaluation of the effects of the guarantee/credit derivative. Information about the components of loss or recovery for each defaulted exposure must be retained, such as amounts recovered, source of recovery (e.g. collateral, liquidation proceeds and guarantees), time period required for recovery, and administrative costs.\n",
      "16.48 | Banks under the foundation approach which utilize supervisory estimates are encouraged to retain the relevant data (i.e. data on loss and recovery experience for corporate exposures under the foundation approach, data on realized losses for banks using the supervisory slotting criteria).\n",
      "Data maintenance: for retail exposures\n",
      "16.49 | Banks must retain data used in the process of allocating exposures to pools, including data on borrower and transaction risk characteristics used either directly or through use of a model, as well as data on delinquency. Banks must also retain data on the estimated PDs, LGDs and EADs, associated with pools of exposures. For defaulted exposures, banks must retain the data on the pools to which the exposure was assigned over the year prior to default and the realized outcomes on LGD and EAD.\n",
      "Stress tests used in assessment of capital adequacy\n",
      "16.50 | An IRB bank must have in place sound stress testing processes for use in the assessment of capital adequacy. Stress testing must involve identifying possible events or future changes in economic conditions that could have unfavorable effects on a bank’s credit exposures and assessment of the bank’s ability to withstand such changes. Examples of scenarios that could be used are:\n",
      " | (1) | Economic or industry downturns;\n",
      " | (2) | Market-risk events; and\n",
      " | (3) | Liquidity conditions.\n",
      "16.51 | In addition to the more general tests described above, the bank must perform a credit risk stress test to assess the effect of certain specific conditions on its IRB regulatory capital requirements. The test to be employed would be one chosen by the bank, subject to supervisory review. The test to be employed must be meaningful and reasonably conservative. Individual banks may develop different approaches to undertaking this stress test requirement, depending on their circumstances. For this purpose, the objective is not to require banks to consider worst-case scenarios. The bank’s stress test in this context should, however, consider at least the effect of mild recession scenarios. In this case, one example might be to use two consecutive quarters of zero growth to assess the effect on the bank’s PDs, LGDs and EADs, taking account – on a conservative basis- of the bank’s international diversification.\n",
      "16.52 | Whatever method is used, the bank must include a consideration of the following sources of information. First, a bank’s own data should allow estimation of the ratings migration of at least some of its exposures. Second, banks should consider information about the impact of smaller deterioration in the credit environment on a bank’s ratings, giving some information on the likely effect of bigger, stress circumstances. Third, banks should evaluate evidence of ratings migration in external ratings. This would include the bank broadly matching its buckets to rating categories.\n",
      "\n",
      "Corporate governance\n",
      "16.53 | All material aspects of the rating and estimation processes must be approved by the bank’s board of directors or a designated authority. These parties must possess a general understanding of the bank’s risk rating system and detailed comprehension of its associated management reports. Senior management must provide notice to the board of directors or a designated committee thereof of material changes or exceptions from established policies that will materially impact the operations of the bank’s rating system.\n",
      "16.54 | Senior management also must have a good understanding of the rating system’s design and operation, and must approve material differences between established procedure and actual practice. Management must also ensure, on an ongoing basis, that the rating system is operating properly. Management and staff in the credit control function must meet regularly to discuss the performance of the rating process, areas needing improvement, and the status of efforts to improve previously identified deficiencies.\n",
      "16.55 | Internal ratings must be an essential part of the reporting to these parties. Reporting must include risk profile by grade, migration across grades, estimation of the relevant parameters per grade, and comparison of realized default rates (and LGDs and EADs for banks on advanced approaches) against expectations. Reporting frequencies may vary with the significance and type of information and the level of the recipient.\n",
      "Credit risk control\n",
      "16.56 | Banks must have independent credit risk control units that are responsible for the design or selection, implementation and performance of their internal rating systems. The unit(s) must be functionally independent from the personnel and management functions responsible for originating exposures. Areas of responsibility must include:\n",
      " | (1) | Testing and monitoring internal grades;\n",
      " | (2) | Production and analysis of summary reports from the bank’s rating system, to include historical default data sorted by rating at the time of default and one year prior to default, grade migration analyses, and monitoring of trends in key rating criteria;\n",
      " | (3) | Implementing procedures to verify that rating definitions are consistently applied across departments and geographic areas;\n",
      " | (4) | Reviewing and documenting any changes to the rating process, including the reasons for the changes; and\n",
      " | (5) | Reviewing the rating criteria to evaluate if they remain predictive of risk. Changes to the rating process, criteria or individual rating parameters must be documented and retained for SAMA to review.\n",
      "16.57 | A credit risk control unit must actively participate in the development, selection, implementation and validation of rating models. It must assume oversight and supervision responsibilities for any models used in the rating process, and ultimate responsibility for the ongoing review and alterations to rating models.\n",
      "Internal and external audit\n",
      "16.58 | Internal audit or an equally independent function must review at least annually, the bank’s rating system and its operations, including the operations of the creditfunction and the estimation of PDs, LGDs and EADs. Areas of review include adherence to all applicable minimum requirements. Internal audit must document its findings.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.59 | Internal ratings and default and loss estimates must play an essential role in the credit approval, risk management, internal capital allocations, and corporate governance functions of banks using the IRB approach. Ratings systems and estimates designed and implemented exclusively for the purpose of qualifying for the IRB approach and used only to provide IRB inputs are not acceptable. It is recognized that banks will not necessarily be using exactly the same estimates for both IRB and all internal purposes. For example, pricing models are likely to use PDs and LGDs relevant to the life of the asset. Where there are such differences, a bank must document them and demonstrate their reasonableness to SAMA.\n",
      "16.60 | A bank must have a credible track record in the use of internal ratings information. Thus, the bank must demonstrate that it has been using a rating system that was broadly in line with the minimum requirements articulated in this document for at least the three years prior to qualification. A bank using the advanced IRB approach must demonstrate that it has been estimating and employing LGDs and EADs in a manner that is broadly consistent with the minimum requirements for use of own estimates of LGDs and EADs for at least the three years prior to qualification. Improvements to a bank’s rating system will not render a bank non-compliant with the three-year requirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall requirements for estimation (structure and intent)\n",
      "16.61 | This section addresses the broad standards for own-estimates of PD, LGD, and EAD. Generally, all banks using the IRB approaches must estimate a PD 65 for each internal borrower grade for corporate, sovereign and bank exposures or for each pool in the case of retail exposures.\n",
      "16.62 | PD estimates must be a long-run average of one-year default rates for borrowers in the grade, with the exception of retail exposures as set out in paragraphs 16.80 and 16.81. Requirements specific to PD estimation are provided in paragraphs 16.76 to 16.81. Banks on the advanced approach must estimate an appropriate LGD (as defined in paragraphs 16.82 to 16.87) for each of its facilities (or retail pools). For exposures subject to the advanced approach, banks must also estimate an appropriate long-run default-weighted average EAD for each of its facilities as defined in paragraphs 16.88 and 16.89. Requirements specific to EAD estimation appear in paragraphs 16.88 to 16.98. For corporate, sovereign and bank exposures, banks that do not meet the requirements for own-estimates of EAD or LGD, above, must use the supervisory estimates of these parameters. Standards for use of such estimates are set out in paragraphs 16.127 to 16.144 .\n",
      "16.63 | Internal estimates of PD, LGD, and EAD must incorporate all relevant, material and available data, information and methods. A bank may utilize internal data and data from external sources (including pooled data). Where internal or external data is used, the bank must demonstrate that its estimates are representative of long run experience.\n",
      "16.64 | Estimates must be grounded in historical experience and empirical evidence, and not based purely on subjective or judgmental considerations. Any changes in lending practice or the process for pursuing recoveries over the observation period must be taken into account. A bank’s estimates must promptly reflect the implications of technical advances and new data and other information, as it becomes available. Banks must review their estimates on a yearly basis or more frequently.\n",
      "16.65 | The population of exposures represented in the data used for estimation, and lending standards in use when the data were generated, and other relevant characteristics should be closely matched to or at least comparable with those of the bank’s exposures and standards. The bank must also demonstrate that economic or market conditions that underlie the data are relevant to current and foreseeable conditions. For estimates of LGD and EAD, banks must take into account paragraphs 16.82 to 16.98. The number of exposures in the sample and the data period used for quantification must be sufficient to provide the bank with confidence in the accuracy and robustness of its estimates. The estimation technique must perform well in out-of-sample tests.\n",
      "16.66 | In general, estimates of PDs, LGDs, and EADs are likely to involve unpredictable errors. In order to avoid over-optimism, a bank must add to its estimates a margin of conservatism that is related to the likely range of errors. Where methods and data are less satisfactory and the likely range of errors is larger, the margin of conservatism must be larger. SAMA may, on case by case basis, allow some flexibility in application of the required standards for data that are collected prior to the date of implementation of this Framework. However, in such cases banks must demonstrate that appropriate adjustments have been made to achieve broad equivalence to the data without such flexibility. Data collected beyond the date of implementation must conform to the minimum standards unless otherwise stated.\n",
      "\n",
      "Definition of default\n",
      "16.67 | A default is considered to have occurred with regard to a particular obligor when either or both of the two following events have taken place.\n",
      " | (1) | The bank considers that the obligor is unlikely to pay its credit obligations to the banking group in full, without recourse by the bank to actions such as realizing security (if held).\n",
      " | (2) | The obligor is past due more than 90 days on any material credit obligation to the banking group. Overdrafts will be considered as being past due once the customer has breached an advised limit or been advised of a limit smaller than current out standings.\n",
      "16.68 | The elements to be taken as indications of unlikeliness to pay include:\n",
      " | (1) | The bank puts the credit obligation on non-accrued status.\n",
      " | (2) | The bank makes a charge-off or account-specific provision resulting from a significant perceived decline in credit quality subsequent to the bank taking on the exposure.\n",
      " | (3) | The bank sells the credit obligation at a material credit-related economic loss.\n",
      " | (4) | The bank consents to a distressed restructuring of the credit obligation where this is likely to result in a diminished financial obligation caused by the material forgiveness, or postponement, of principal, interest or (where relevant) fees.\n",
      " | (5) | The bank has filed for the obligor’s bankruptcy or a similar order in respect of the obligor’s credit obligation to the banking group.\n",
      " | (6) | The obligor has sought or has been placed in bankruptcy or similar protection where this would avoid or delay repayment of the credit obligation to the banking group.\n",
      "16.69 | SAMA will provide appropriate guidance as to how these elements must be implemented and monitored.\n",
      "16.70 | For retail exposures, the definition of default can be applied at the level of a particular facility, rather than at the level of the obligor. As such, default by a borrower on one obligation does not require a bank to treat all other obligations to the banking group as defaulted.\n",
      "16.71 | A bank must record actual defaults on IRB exposure classes using this reference definition. A bank must also use the reference definition for its estimation of PDs, and (where relevant) LGDs and EADs. In arriving at these estimations, a bank may use external data available to it that is not itself consistent with that definition, subject to the requirements set out in paragraph 16.77. However, in such cases, banks must demonstrate to SAMA that appropriate adjustments to the data have been made to achieve broad equivalence with the reference definition. This same condition would apply to any internal data used up to implementation of this Framework. Internal data (including that pooled by banks) used in such estimates beyond the date of implementation of this Framework must be consistent with the reference definition.\n",
      "16.72 | If the bank considers that a previously defaulted exposure’s status is such that no trigger of the reference definition any longer applies, the bank must rate the borrower and estimate LGD as they would for a non-defaulted facility. Should the reference definition subsequently be triggered, a second default would be deemed to have occurred.\n",
      "Re-ageing\n",
      "16.73 | The bank must have clearly articulated and documented policies in respect of the counting of days past due, in particular in respect of the re-ageing of the facilities and the granting of extensions, deferrals, renewals and rewrites to existing accounts. At a minimum, the re-ageing policy must include: (a) approval authorities and reporting requirements; (b) minimum age of a facility before it is eligible for re-ageing; (c) delinquency levels of facilities that are eligible for re- ageing; (d) maximum number of re-ageings per facility; and (e) a reassessment of the borrower’s capacity to repay. These policies must be applied consistently over time, and must support the ‘use test’ (ie if a bank treats a re-aged exposure in a similar fashion to other delinquent exposures more than the past-due cut off point, this exposure must be recorded as in default for IRB purposes).\n",
      "Treatment of overdrafts\n",
      "16.74 | Authorized overdrafts must be subject to a credit limit set by the bank and brought to the knowledge of the client. Any break of this limit must be monitored; if the account were not brought under the limit after 90 to 180 days (subject to the applicable past-due trigger), it would be considered as defaulted. Non-authorized overdrafts will be associated with a zero limit for IRB purposes. Thus, days past due commence once any credit is granted to an unauthorized customer; if such credit were not repaid within 90 to 180 days, the exposure would be considered in default. Banks must have in place rigorous internal policies for assessing the creditworthiness of customers who are offered overdraft accounts.\n",
      "Definition of loss for all asset classes\n",
      "16.75 | The definition of loss used in estimating LGD is economic loss. When measuring economic loss, all relevant factors should be taken into account. This must include material discount effects and material direct and indirect costs associated with collecting on the exposure. Banks must not simply measure the loss recorded in accounting records, although they must be able to compare accounting and economic losses. The bank’s own workout and collection expertise significantly influences their recovery rates and must be reflected in their LGD estimates, but adjustments to estimates for such expertise must be conservative until the bank has sufficient internal empirical evidence of the impact of its expertise.\n",
      "Requirements specific to PD estimation: corporate, sovereign and bank exposures\n",
      "16.76 | Banks must use information and techniques that take appropriate account of the long-run experience when estimating the average PD for each rating grade. For example, banks may use one or more of the three specific techniques set out below: internal default experience, mapping to external data, and statistical default models.\n",
      "16.77 | Banks may have a primary technique and use others as a point of comparison and potential adjustment. SAMA will not be satisfied by mechanical application of a technique without supporting analysis. Banks must recognize the importance of judgmental considerations in combining results of techniques and in making adjustments for limitations of techniques and information. For all methods listed below, banks must estimate a PD for each rating grade based on the observed historical average one-year default rate that is a simple average based on number of obligors (count weighted). Weighting approaches, such as EAD weighting, are not permitted.\n",
      " | (1) | A bank may use data on internal default experience for the estimation of PD. A bank must demonstrate in its analysis that the estimates are reflective of underwriting standards and of any differences in the rating system that generated the data and the current rating system. Where only limited data are available, or where underwriting standards or rating systems have changed, the bank must add a greater margin of conservatism in its estimate of PD. The use of pooled data across institutions may also be recognized. A bank must demonstrate that the internal rating systems and criteria of other banks in the pool are comparable with its own.\n",
      " | (2) | Banks may associate or map their internal grades to the scale used by an external credit assessment institution or similar institution and then attribute the default rate observed for the external institution’s grades to the bank’s grades. Mappings must be based on a comparison of internal rating criteria to the criteria used by the external institution and on a comparison of the internal and external ratings of any common borrowers. Biases or inconsistencies in the mapping approach or underlying data must be avoided. The external institution’s criteria underlying the data used for quantification must be oriented to the risk of the borrower and not reflect transaction characteristics. The bank’s analysis must include a comparison of the default definitions used, subject to the requirements in paragraphs 16.67 to 16.72. The bank must document the basis for the mapping.\n",
      " | (3) | A bank is allowed to use a simple average of default-probability estimates for individual borrowers in a given grade, where such estimates are drawn from statistical default prediction models. The bank’s use of default probability models for this purpose must meet the standards specified in paragraph 16.33 .\n",
      "16.78 | Irrespective of whether a bank is using external, internal, or pooled data sources, or a combination of the three, for its PD estimation, the length of the underlying historical observation period used must be at least five years for at least one source. If the available observation period spans a longer period for any source, and this data are relevant and material, this longer period must be used. The data should include a representative mix of good and bad years.\n",
      "Requirements specific to PD estimation: retail exposures\n",
      "16.79 | Given the bank-specific basis of assigning exposures to pools, banks must regard internal data as the primary source of information for estimating loss characteristics. Banks are permitted to use external data or statistical models for quantification provided a strong link can be demonstrated between: (a) the bank’s process of assigning exposures to a pool and the process used by the external data source; and (b) between the bank’s internal risk profile and the composition of the external data. In all cases banks must use all relevant and material data sources as points of comparison.\n",
      "16.80 | One method for deriving long-run average estimates of PD and default- weighted average loss rates given default (as defined in paragraph 16.82) for retail would be based on an estimate of the expected long-run loss rate. A bank may (i) use an appropriate PD estimate to infer the long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default, or (ii) use a long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default to infer the appropriate PD. In either case, it is important to recognize that the LGD used for the IRB capital calculation cannot be less than the long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default and must be consistent with the concepts defined in paragraph 16.82.\n",
      "16.81 | Irrespective of whether banks are using external, internal, pooled data sources, or a combination of the three, for their estimation of loss characteristics, the length of the underlying historical observation period used must be at least five years. If the available observation spans a longer period for any source, and these data are relevant, this longer period must be used. The data should include a representative mix of good and bad years of the economic cycle relevant for the portfolio. The PD should be based on the observed historical average one-year default rate.\n",
      "Requirements specific to own-LGD estimates: standards for all asset classes\n",
      "16.82 | A bank must estimate an LGD for each facility that aims to reflect economic downturn conditions where necessary to capture the relevant risks. This LGD cannot be less than the long-run default-weighted average loss rate given default calculated based on the average economic loss of all observed defaults within the data source for that type of facility. In addition, a bank must take into account the potential for the LGD of the facility to be higher than the default-weighted average during a period when credit losses are substantially higher than average. For certain types of exposures, loss severities may not exhibit such cyclical variability and LGD estimates may not differ materially from the long-run default- weighted average. However, for other exposures, this cyclical variability in loss severities may be important and banks will need to incorporate it into their LGD estimates. For this purpose, banks may make reference to the averages of loss severities observed during periods of high credit losses, forecasts based on appropriately conservative assumptions, or other similar methods. Appropriate estimates of LGD during periods of high credit losses might be formed using either internal and/or external data. SAMA will continue to monitor and encourage the development of appropriate approaches to this issue.\n",
      "16.83 | In its analysis, the bank must consider the extent of any dependence between the risk of the borrower and that of the collateral or collateral provider. Cases where there is a significant degree of dependence must be addressed in a conservative manner. Any currency mismatch between the underlying obligation and the collateral must also be considered and treated conservatively in the bank’s assessment of LGD.\n",
      "16.84 | LGD estimates must be grounded in historical recovery rates and, when applicable, must not solely be based on the collateral’s estimated market value. This requirement recognizes the potential inability of banks to gain both control of their collateral and liquidate it expeditiously. To the extent that LGD estimates take into account the existence of collateral, banks must establish internal requirements for collateral management, operational procedures, legal certainty and risk management process that are generally consistent with those required for the foundation IRB approach.\n",
      "16.85 | Recognizing the principle that realized losses can at times systematically exceed expected levels, the LGD assigned to a defaulted asset should reflect the possibility that the bank would have to recognize additional, unexpected losses during the recovery period. For each defaulted asset, the bank must also construct its best estimate of the expected loss on that asset based on current economic circumstances and facility status. The amount, if any, by which the LGD on a defaulted asset exceeds the bank’s best estimate of expected loss on the asset represents the capital requirement for that asset, and should be set by the bank on a risk-sensitive basis in accordance with paragraph 11.3 .Instances where the best estimate of expected loss on a defaulted asset is less than the sum of specific provisions and partial charge- offs on that asset will attract supervisory scrutiny and must be justified by the bank.\n",
      "Requirements specific to own-LGD estimates: additional standards for corporate and sovereign exposures\n",
      "16.86 | Estimates of LGD must be based on a minimum data observation period that should ideally cover at least one complete economic cycle but must in any case be no shorter than a period of seven years for at least one source. If the available observation period spans a longer period for any source, and the data are relevant, this longer period must be used.\n",

      "16.87 | The minimum data observation period for LGD estimates for retail exposures is five years. The less data a bank has the more conservative it must be in its estimation.\n",
      "Requirements specific to own-EAD estimates: standards for all asset classes\n",
      "16.88 | EAD for an on-balance sheet or off-balance sheet item is defined as the expected gross exposure of the facility upon default of the obligor. For on-balance sheet items, banks must estimate EAD at no less than the current drawn amount, subject to recognizing the effects of on-balance sheet netting as specified in the foundation approach. The minimum requirements for the recognition of netting are the same as those under the foundation approach. The additional minimum requirements for internal estimation of EAD under the advanced approach, therefore, focus on the estimation of EAD for off- balance sheet items (excluding transactions that expose banks to counterparty credit risk as set out in chapter 5 of the Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) framework ). Banks using the advanced approach must have established procedures in place for the estimation of EAD for off-balance sheet items. These must specify the estimates of EAD to be used for each facility type. Banks’ estimates of EAD should reflect the possibility of additional drawings by the borrower up to and after the time a default event is triggered. Where estimates of EAD differ by facility type, the delineation of these facilities must be clear and unambiguous.\n",
      "16.89 | Under the advanced approach, banks must assign an estimate of EAD for each eligible facility. It must be an estimate of the long-run default-weighted average EAD for similar facilities and borrowers over a sufficiently long period of time, but with a margin of conservatism appropriate to the likely range of errors in the estimate. If a positive correlation can reasonably be expected between the default frequency and the magnitude of EAD, the EAD estimate must incorporate a larger margin of conservatism. Moreover, for exposures for which EAD estimates are volatile over the economic cycle, the bank must use EAD estimates that are appropriate for an economic downturn, if these are more conservative than the long-run average. For banks that have been able to develop their own EAD models, this could be achieved by considering the cyclical nature, if any, of the drivers of such models. Other banks may have sufficient internal data to examine the impact of previous recession(s). However, some banks may only have the option of making conservative use of external data. Moreover, where a bank bases its estimates on alternative measures of central tendency (such as the median or a higher percentile estimate) or only on ‘downturn’ data, it should explicitly confirm that the basic downturn requirement of the framework is met, ie the bank’s estimates do not fall below a (conservative) estimate of the long-run default- weighted average EAD for similar facilities.\n",
      "16.90 | The criteria by which estimates of EAD are derived must be plausible and intuitive, and represent what the bank believes to be the material drivers of EAD. The choices must be supported by credible internal analysis by the bank. The bank must be able to provide a breakdown of its EAD experience by the factors it sees as the drivers of EAD. A bank must use all relevant and material information in its derivation of EAD estimates. Across facility types, a bank must review its estimates of EAD when material new information comes to light and at least on an annual basis.\n",
      "16.91 | Due consideration must be paid by the bank to its specific policies and strategies adopted in respect of account monitoring and payment processing. The bank must also consider its ability and willingness to prevent further drawings in circumstances short of payment default, such as covenant violations or other technical default events. Banks must also have adequate systems and procedures in place to monitor facility amounts, current outstandings against committed lines and changes in outstandings per borrower and per grade. The bank must be able to monitor outstanding balances on a daily basis.\n",
      "16.92 | Banks’ EAD estimates must be developed using a 12-month fixed-horizon approach; i.e. for each observation in the reference data set, default outcomes must be linked to relevant obligor and facility characteristics twelve months prior to default.\n",
      "16.93 | As set out in paragraph 16.65, banks’ EAD estimates should be based on reference data that reflect the obligor, facility and bank management practice characteristics of the exposures to which the estimates are applied. Consistent with this principle, EAD estimates applied to particular exposures should not be based on data that comingle the effects of disparate characteristics or data from exposures that exhibit different characteristics (e.g. same broad product grouping but different customers that are managed differently by the bank). The estimates should be based on appropriately homogenous segments. Alternatively, the estimates should be based on an estimation approach that effectively disentangles the impact of the different characteristics exhibited within the relevant dataset. Practices that generally do not comply with this principle include use of estimates based or partly based on:\n",
      " | (1) | SME/midmarket data being applied to large corporate obligors.\n",
      " | (2) | Data from commitments with ‘small’ unused limit availability being applied to facilities with ‘large’ unused limit availability.\n",
      " | (3) | Data from obligors already identified as problematic at reference date being applied to current obligors with no known issues (e.g. customers at reference date who were already delinquent, watch listed by the bank, subject to recent bank-initiated limit reductions, blocked from further drawdowns or subject to other types of collections activity).\n",
      " | (4) | Data that has been affected by changes in obligors’ mix of borrowing and other credit-related products over the observation period unless that data has been effectively mitigated for such changes, e.g. by adjusting the data to remove the effects of the changes in the product mix. SAMA expects banks to demonstrate a detailed understanding of the impact of changes in customer product mix on EAD reference data sets (and associated EAD estimates) and that the impact is immaterial or has been effectively mitigated within each bank’s estimation process. Banks’ analyses in this regard will be actively challenged by SAMA. Effective mitigation would not include: setting floors to credit conversion factor (CCF)/EAD observations; use of obligor-level estimates that do not fully cover the relevant product transformation options or inappropriately combine products with very different characteristics (e.g. revolving and non-revolving products); adjusting only ‘material’ observations affected by product transformation; generally excluding observations affected by product profile transformation (thereby potentially distorting the representativeness of the remaining data).\n",
      "16.94 | A well-known feature of the commonly used undrawn limit factor (ULF) approach 66 to estimating CCFs is the region of instability associated with facilities close to being fully drawn at reference date. Banks should ensure that their EAD estimates are effectively quarantined from the potential effects of this region of instability.\n",
      " | (1) | An acceptable approach could include using an estimation method other than the ULF approach that avoids the instability issue by not using potentially small undrawn limits that could approach zero in the denominator or, as appropriate, switching to a method other than the ULF as the region of instability is approached, e.g. a limit factor, balance factor or additional utilization factor approach 67 . Note that, consistent with paragraph 16.93, including limit utilization as a driver in EAD models could quarantine much of the relevant portfolio from this issue but, in the absence of other actions, leaves open how to develop appropriate EAD estimates to be applied to exposures within the region of instability.\n",
      " | (2) | Common but ineffective approaches to mitigating this issue include capping and flooring reference data (e.g. observed CCFs at 100 per cent and zero respectively) or omitting observations that are judged to be affected.\n",
      "16.95 | EAD reference data must not be capped to the principal amount outstanding or facility limits. Accrued interest, other due payments and limit excesses should be included in EAD reference data.\n",

      "16.99 | When a bank uses its own estimates of LGD, it may reflect the risk-mitigating effect of guarantees through an adjustment to PD or LGD estimates. The option to adjust LGDs is available only to those banks that have been approved to use their own internal estimates of LGD. For retail exposures, where guarantees exist, either in support of an individual obligation or a pool of exposures, a bank may reflect the risk-reducing effect either through its estimates of PD or LGD, provided this is done consistently. In adopting one or the other technique, a bank must adopt a consistent approach, both across types of guarantees and over time.\n",
      "16.100 | In all cases, both the borrower and all recognized guarantors must be assigned a borrower rating at the outset and on an ongoing basis. A bank must follow all minimum requirements for assigning borrower ratings set out in this document, including the regular monitoring of the guarantor’s condition and ability and willingness to honour its obligations. Consistent with the requirements in paragraphs 16.46 and 16.47 , a bank must retain all relevant information on the borrower absent the guarantee and the guarantor. In the case of retail guarantees, these requirements also apply to the assignment of an exposure to a pool, and the estimation of PD.\n",
      "16.101 | In no case can the bank assign the guaranteed exposure an adjusted PD or LGD such that the adjusted risk weight would be lower than that of a comparable, direct exposure to the guarantor. Neither criteria nor rating processes are permitted to consider possible favorable effects of imperfect expected correlation between default events for the borrower and guarantor for purposes of regulatory minimum capital requirements. As such, the adjusted risk weight must not reflect the risk mitigation of “double default.”\n",
      "16.102 | In case the bank applies the standardized approach to direct exposures to the guarantor, the guarantee may only be recognized by treating the covered portion of the exposure as a direct exposure to the guarantor under the standardized approach. Similarly, in case the bank applies the foundation IRB approach to direct exposures to the guarantor, the guarantee may only be recognized by applying the foundation IRB approach to the covered portion of the exposure. Alternatively, banks may choose to not recognize the effect of guarantees on their exposures.\n",
      "16.103 | There are no restrictions on the types of eligible guarantors. The bank must, however, have clearly specified criteria for the types of guarantors it will recognize for regulatory capital purposes.\n",
      "16.104 | The guarantee must be evidenced in writing, non-cancellable on the part of the guarantor, in force until the debt is satisfied in full (to the extent of the amount and tenor of the guarantee) and legally enforceable against the guarantor in a jurisdiction where the guarantor has assets to attach and enforce a judgement. The guarantee must also be unconditional; there should be no clause in the protection contract outside the direct control of the bank that could prevent the protection provider from being obliged to pay out in a timely manner in the event that the original counterparty fails to make the payment(s) due. However, under the advanced IRB approach, guarantees that only cover loss remaining after the bank has first pursued the original obligor for payment and has completed the workout process may be recognized.\n",

      "16.107 | The criteria must be plausible and intuitive, and must address the guarantor’s ability and willingness to perform under the guarantee. The criteria must also address the likely timing of any payments and the degree to which the guarantor’s ability to perform under the guarantee is correlated with the borrower’s ability to repay.

In addition, methods and data for estimating PD, LGD, and EL must comply with the existing risk quantification standards for retail exposures. In particular, quantification should reflect all information available to the purchasing bank regarding the quality of the underlying receivables, including data for similar pools provided by the seller, by the purchasing bank, or by external sources. The purchasing bank must determine whether the data provided by the seller are consistent with expectations agreed upon by both parties concerning, for example, the type, volume and on-going quality of receivables purchased.

They must meet the following additional minimum requirements in order to receive recognition for additional collateral types.\n",
      "Definition of eligibility of commercial and residential real estate as collateral\n",
      "16.128 | Eligible commercial and residential real estate collateral for corporate, sovereign and bank exposures are defined as:\n",
      " | (1) | Collateral where the risk of the borrower is not materially dependent upon the performance of the underlying property or project, but rather on the underlying capacity of the borrower to repay the debt from other sources. As such, repayment of the facility is not materially dependent on any cash flow generated by the underlying commercial or residential real estate serving as collateral; and\n",
      " | (2) | Additionally, the value of the collateral pledged must not be materially dependent on the performance of the borrower. This requirement is not intended to preclude situations where purely macro-economic factors affect both the value of the collateral and the performance of the borrower.\n",
      "16.129 | In light of the generic description above and the definition of corporate exposures, income producing real estate that falls under the SL asset class is specifically excluded from recognition as collateral for corporate exposures. 68\n",
      "\n",
      "Operational requirements for eligible commercial or residential real estate\n",
      "16.130 | Subject to meeting the definition above, commercial and residential real estate will be eligible for recognition as collateral for corporate claims only if all of the following operational requirements are met.\n",
      " | (1) | Legal enforceability: any claim on collateral taken must be legally enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions, and any claim on collateral must be properly filed on a timely basis. Collateral interests must reflect a perfected lien (i.e. all legal requirements for establishing the claim have been fulfilled). Furthermore, the collateral agreement and the legal process underpinning it must be such that they provide for the bank to realize the value of the collateral within a reasonable timeframe.\n",
      " | (2) | Objective market value of collateral: the collateral must be valued at or less than the current fair value under which the property could be sold under private contract between a willing seller and an arm’s-length buyer on the date of valuation.\n",
      " | (3) | Frequent revaluation: the bank is expected to monitor the value of the collateral on a frequent basis and at a minimum once every year. More frequent monitoring is suggested where the market is subject to significant changes in conditions. Statistical methods of evaluation (e.g. reference to house price indices, sampling) may be used to update estimates or to identify collateral that may have declined in value and that may need re- appraisal. A qualified professional must evaluate the property when information indicates that the value of the collateral may have declined materially relative to general market prices or when a credit event, such as default, occurs.\n",
      " | (4) | Junior liens: In some member countries, eligible collateral will be restricted to situations where the lender has a first charge over the property. Junior liens may be taken into account where there is no doubt that the claim for collateral is legally enforceable and constitutes an efficient credit risk mitigant. Where junior liens are recognized the bank must first take the haircut value of the collateral, then reduce it by the sum of all loans with liens that rank higher than the junior lien, the remaining value is the collateral that supports the loan with the junior lien. In cases where liens are held by third parties that rank pari passu with the lien of the bank, only the proportion of the collateral (after the application of haircuts and reductions due to the value of loans with liens that rank higher than the lien of the bank) that is attributable to the bank may be recognized.\n",
      "16.131 | Additional collateral management requirements are as follows:\n",
      " | (1) | The types of commercial and residential real estate collateral accepted by the bank and lending policies (advance rates) when this type of collateral is taken must be clearly documented.\n",
      " | (2) | The bank must take steps to ensure that the property taken as collateral is adequately insured against damage or deterioration.\n",
      " | (3) | The bank must monitor on an ongoing basis the extent of any permissible prior claims (e.g. tax) on the property.\n",
      " | (4) | The bank must appropriately monitor the risk of environmental liability arising in respect of the collateral, such as the presence of toxic material on a property.\n",
      "Requirements for recognition of financial receivables : definition of eligible receivables\n",
      "16.132 | Eligible financial receivables are claims with an original maturity of less than or equal to one year where repayment will occur through the commercial or financial flows related to the underlying assets of the borrower. This includes both self-liquidating debt arising from the sale of goods or services linked to a commercial transaction and general amounts owed by buyers, suppliers, renters, national and local governmental authorities, or other non-affiliated parties not related to the sale of goods or services linked to a commercial transaction. Eligible receivables do not include those associated with securitizations, sub- participations or credit derivatives.\n",
      "Requirements for recognition of financial receivables: legal certainty\n",
      "16.133 | The legal mechanism by which collateral is given must be robust and ensure that the lender has clear rights over the proceeds from the collateral.\n",
      "16.134 | Banks must take all steps necessary to fulfil local requirements in respect of the enforceability of security interest, e.g. by registering a security interest with a registrar. There should be a framework that allows the potential lender to have a perfected first priority claim over the collateral.\n",
      "16.135 | All documentation used in collateralized transactions must be binding on all parties and legally enforceable in all relevant jurisdictions. Banks must have conducted sufficient legal review to verify this and have a well-founded legal basis to reach this conclusion, and undertake such further review as necessary to ensure continuing enforceability.\n",
      "16.136 | The collateral arrangements must be properly documented, with a clear and robust procedure for the timely collection of collateral proceeds. Banks’ procedures should ensure that any legal conditions required for declaring the default of the customer and timely collection of collateral are observed. In the event of the obligor’s financial distress or default, the bank should have legal authority to sell or assign the receivables to other parties without consent of the receivables’ obligors.\n",
      "Requirements for recognition of financial receivables: risk management\n",
      "16.137 | The bank must have a sound process for determining the credit risk in the receivables. Such a process should include, among other things, analyses of the borrower’s business and industry (e.g. effects of the business cycle) and the types of customers with whom the borrower does business. Where the bank relies on the borrower to ascertain the credit risk of the customers, the bank must review the borrower’s credit policy to ascertain its soundness and credibility.\n",
      "16.138 | The margin between the amount of the exposure and the value of the receivables must reflect all appropriate factors, including the cost of collection, concentration within the receivables pool pledged by an individual borrower, and potential concentration risk within the bank’s total exposures.\n",
      "16.139 | The bank must maintain a continuous monitoring process that is appropriate for the specific exposures (either immediate or contingent) attributable to the collateral to be utilized as a risk mitigant. This process may include, as appropriate and relevant, ageing reports, control of trade documents, borrowing base certificates, frequent audits of collateral, confirmation of accounts, control of the proceeds of accounts paid, analyses of dilution (credits given by the borrower to the issuers) and regular financial analysis of both the borrower and the issuers of the receivables, especially in the case when a small number of large-sized receivables are taken as collateral. Observance of the bank’s overall concentration limits should be monitored. Additionally, compliance with loan covenants, environmental restrictions, and other legal requirements should be reviewed on a regular basis\n",
      "16.140 | The receivables pledged by a borrower should be diversified and not be unduly correlated with the borrower. Where the correlation is high, e.g. where some issuers of the receivables are reliant on the borrower for their viability or the borrower and the issuers belong to a common industry, the attendant risks should be taken into account in the setting of margins for the collateral pool as a whole. Receivables from affiliates of the borrower (including subsidiaries and employees) will not be recognized as risk mitigants.\n",
      "16.141 | The bank should have a documented process for collecting receivable payments in distressed situations. The requisite facilities for collection should be in place, even when the bank normally looks to the borrower for collections.\n",
      "Requirements for recognition of other physical collateral\n",
      "16.142 | SAMA may allow for recognition of the credit risk mitigating effect of certain other physical collateral when the following conditions are met:\n",
      " | (1) | The bank demonstrates to the satisfaction of SAMA that there are liquid markets for disposal of collateral in an expeditious and economically efficient manner. Banks must carry out a reassessment of this condition both periodically and when information indicates material changes in the market.\n",
      " | (2) | The bank demonstrates to the satisfaction of SAMA that there are well- established, publicly available market prices for the collateral. Banks must also demonstrate that the amount they receive when collateral is realized does not deviate significantly from these market prices.\n",
      "16.143 | In order for a given bank to receive recognition for additional physical collateral, it must meet all the requirements in paragraphs 16.130 and 16.131, subject to the following modifications:\n",
      " | (1) | With the sole exception of permissible prior claims specified in the footnote to paragraph 16.130, only first liens on, or charges over, collateral are permissible. As such, the bank must have priority over all other lenders to the realized proceeds of the collateral.\n",
      " | (2) | The loan agreement must include detailed descriptions of the collateral and the right to examine and revalue the collateral whenever this is deemed necessary by the lending bank.\n",
      " | (3) | The types of physical collateral accepted by the bank and policies and practices in respect of the appropriate amount of each type of collateral relative to the exposure amount must be clearly documented in internal credit policies and procedures and available for examination and/or audit review.\n",
      " | (4) | Bank credit policies with regard to the transaction structure must address appropriate collateral requirements relative to the exposure amount, the ability to liquidate the collateral readily, the ability to establish objectively a price or market value, the frequency with which the value can readily be obtained (including a professional appraisal or valuation), and the volatility of the value of the collateral. The periodic revaluation process must pay particular attention to “fashion-sensitive” collateral to ensure that valuations are appropriately adjusted downward of fashion, or model-year, obsolescence as well as physical obsolescence or deterioration.\n",
      " | (5) | In cases of inventories (e.g. raw materials, work-in-process, finished goods, dealers’ inventories of autos) and equipment, the periodic revaluation process must include physical inspection of the collateral.\n",
      "16.144 | General Security Agreements, and other forms of floating charge, can provide the lending bank with a registered claim over a company’s assets. In cases where the registered claim includes both assets that are not eligible as collateral under the foundation IRB and assets that are eligible as collateral under the foundation IRB, the bank may recognize the latter. Recognition is conditional on the claims meeting the operational requirements set out in paragraphs 16.127 to 16.143.\n",
      "\n",
      "16.145 | Leases other than those that expose the bank to residual value risk (see paragraph 16.146) will be accorded the same treatment as exposures collateralized by the same type of collateral. The minimum requirements for the collateral type must be met (commercial or residential real estate or other collateral). In addition, the bank must also meet the following standards:\n",
      " | (1) | Robust risk management on the part of the lessor with respect to the location of the asset, the use to which it is put, its age, and planned obsolescence;\n",
      " | (2) | A robust legal framework establishing the lessor’s legal ownership of the asset and its ability to exercise its rights as owner in a timely fashion; and\n",
      " | (3) | The difference between the rate of depreciation of the physical asset and the rate of amortization of the lease payments must not be so large as to overstate the credit risk mitigation attributed to the leased assets.\n",
      "16.146 | Leases that expose the bank to residual value risk will be treated in the following manner. Residual value risk is the bank’s exposure to potential loss due to the fair value of the equipment declining below its residual estimate at lease inception.\n",
      " | (1) | The discounted lease payment stream will receive a risk weight appropriate for the lessee’s financial strength (PD) and supervisory or own-estimate of LGD, whichever is appropriate.\n",

      "18.1 | Banks must apply the securitization framework for determining regulatory capital requirements on exposures arising from traditional and synthetic securitizations or similar structures that contain features common to both. Since securitizations may be structured in many different ways, the capital treatment of a securitization exposure must be determined on the basis of its economic substance rather than its legal form. Banks are encouraged to consult with SAMA when there is uncertainty about whether a given transaction should be considered a securitization. For example, transactions involving cash flows from real estate (e.g. rents) may be considered specialized lending exposures, if warranted.\n",
      "18.2 | A traditional securitization is a structure where the cash flow from an underlying pool of exposures is used to service at least two different stratified risk positions or tranches reflecting different degrees of credit risk. Payments to the investors depend upon the performance of the specified underlying exposures, as opposed to being derived from an obligation of the entity originating those exposures. The stratified/tranched structures that characterize securitizations differ from ordinary senior/subordinated debt instruments in that junior securitization tranches can absorb losses without interrupting contractual payments to more senior tranches, whereas subordination in a senior/subordinated debt structure is a matter of priority of rights to the proceeds of liquidation.\n",
      "18.3 | A synthetic securitization is a structure with at least two different stratified risk positions or tranches that reflect different degrees of credit risk where credit risk of an underlying pool of exposures is transferred, in whole or in part, through the use of funded (e.g. credit-linked notes) or unfunded (e.g. credit default swaps) credit derivatives or guarantees that serve to hedge the credit risk of the portfolio. Accordingly, the investors’ potential risk is dependent upon the performance of the underlying pool.\n",
      "18.4 | Banks’ exposures to a securitization are hereafter referred to as “securitization exposures”. Securitization exposures can include but are not restricted to the following: asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, credit enhancements, liquidity facilities, interest rate or currency swaps, credit derivatives and tranched cover as described in 9.81 . Reserve accounts, such as cash collateral accounts, recorded as an asset by the originating bank must also be treated as securitization exposures.\n",
      "18.5 | Resecuritization exposure is a securitization exposure in which the risk associated with an underlying pool of exposures is tranched and at least one of the underlying exposures is a securitization exposure. In addition, an exposure to one or more resecuritization exposures is a resecuritization exposure. An exposure resulting from retranching of a securitization exposure is not a resecuritization exposure if the bank is able to demonstrate that the cash flows to and from the bank could be replicated in all circumstances and conditions by an exposure to the securitization of a pool of assets that contains no securitization exposures.\n",
      "18.6 | Underlying instruments in the pool being securitized may include but are not restricted to the following: loans, commitments, asset-backed and mortgage- backed securities, corporate bonds, equity securities, and private equity investments. The underlying pool may include one or more exposures.\n",
      "\n",
      "18.7 | For risk-based capital purposes, a bank is considered to be an originator with regard to a certain securitization if it meets either of the following conditions:\n",
      " | (1) | The bank originates directly or indirectly underlying exposures included in the securitization; or\n",
      " | (2) | The bank serves as a sponsor of an asset-backed commercial paper (ABCP) conduit or similar programme that acquires exposures from third-party entities. In the context of such programmes, a bank would generally be considered a sponsor and, in turn, an originator if it, in fact or in substance, manages or advises the programme, places securities into the market, or provides liquidity and/or credit enhancements.\n",
      "18.8 | An ABCP programme predominantly issues commercial paper to third-party investors with an original maturity of one year or less and is backed by assets or other exposures held in a bankruptcy-remote, special purpose entity.\n",
      "18.9 | A clean-up call is an option that permits the securitization exposures (e.g. asset- backed securities) to be called before all of the underlying exposures or securitization exposures have been repaid. In the case of traditional securitizations, this is generally accomplished by repurchasing the remaining securitization exposures once the pool balance or outstanding securities have fallen below some specified level. In the case of a synthetic transaction, the clean- up call may take the form of a clause that extinguishes the credit protection.\n",
      "18.10 | A credit enhancement is a contractual arrangement in which the bank or other entity retains or assumes a securitization exposure and, in substance, provide some degree of added protection to other parties to the transaction.\n",
      "18.11 | A credit-enhancing interest-only strip (I/O) is an on-balance sheet asset that\n",
      " | (1) | Represents a valuation of cash flows related to future margin income, and\n",
      " | (2) | Is subordinated.\n",
      "18.12 | An early amortization provision is a mechanism that, once triggered, accelerates the reduction of the investor’s interest in underlying exposures of a securitization of revolving credit facilities and allows investors to be paid out prior to the originally stated maturity of the securities issued. A securitization of revolving credit facilities is a securitization in which one or more underlying exposures represent, directly or indirectly, current or future draws on a revolving credit facility. Examples of revolving credit facilities include but are not limited to credit card exposures, home equity lines of credit, commercial lines of credit, and other lines of credit.\n",
      "18.13 | Excess spread (or future margin income) is defined as gross finance charge collections and other income received by the trust or special purpose entity (SPE, as defined below) minus certificate interest, servicing fees, charge-offs, and other senior trust or SPE expenses.\n",
      "18.14 | Implicit support arises when a bank provides support to a securitization in excess of its predetermined contractual obligation.\n",
      "18.15 | For risk-based capital purposes, an internal ratings-based (IRB) pool means a securitization pool for which a bank is able to use an IRB approach to calculate capital requirements for all underlying exposures given that it has approval to apply IRB for the type of underlying exposures and it has sufficient information to calculate IRB capital requirements for these exposures. A bank which has a SAMA-approved IRB approach for the entire pool of exposures underlying a given securitization exposure that cannot estimate capital requirements for all underlying exposures using an IRB approach would be expected to demonstrate to SAMA why it is unable to do so. However, SAMA may prohibit a bank from treating an IRB pool as such in the case of particular structures or transactions, including transactions with highly complex loss allocations, tranches whose credit enhancement could be eroded for reasons other than portfolio losses, and tranches of portfolios with high internal correlations (such as portfolios with high exposure to single sectors or with high geographical concentration).\n",
      "18.16 | For risk-based capital purposes, a mixed pool means a securitization pool for which a bank is able to calculate IRB parameters for some, but not all, underlying exposures in a securitization.\n",
      "18.17 | For risk-based capital purposes, a standardized approach (SA) pool means a securitization pool for which a bank does not have approval to calculate IRB parameters for any underlying exposures; or for which, while the bank has approval to calculate IRB parameters for some or all of the types of underlying exposures, it is unable to calculate IRB parameters for any underlying exposures because of lack of relevant data, or is prohibited by SAMA from treating the pool as an IRB pool pursuant to 18.15.\n",
      "18.18 | A securitization exposure (tranche) is considered to be a senior exposure (tranche) if it is effectively backed or secured by a first claim on the entire amount of the assets in the underlying securitized pool. 69 While this generally includes only the most senior position within a securitization transaction, in some instances there may be other claims that, in a technical sense, may be more senior in the waterfall (e.g. a swap claim) but may be disregarded for the purpose of determining which positions are treated as senior. Different maturities of several senior tranches that share pro rata loss allocation shall have no effect on the seniority of these tranches, since they benefit from the same level of credit enhancement. The material effects of differing tranche maturities are captured by maturity adjustments on the risk weights to be assigned to the securitization exposures. For example:\n",
      " | (1) | In a typical synthetic securitization, an unrated tranche would be treated as a senior tranche, provided that all of the conditions for inferring a rating from a lower tranche that meets the definition of a senior tranche are fulfilled.\n",
      " | (2) | In a traditional securitization where all tranches above the first-loss piece are rated, the most highly rated position would be treated as a senior tranche. When there are several tranches that share the same rating, only the most senior tranche in the cash flow waterfall would be treated as senior (unless the only difference among them is the effective maturity). Also, when the different ratings of several senior tranches only result from a difference in maturity, all of these tranches should be treated as a senior tranche.\n",
      " | (3) | Usually, a liquidity facility supporting an ABCP programme would not be the most senior position within the programme; the commercial paper, which benefits from the liquidity support, typically would be the most senior position. However, a liquidity facility may be viewed as covering all losses on the underlying receivables pool that exceed the amount of overcollateralization/reserves provided by the seller and as being most senior if it is sized to cover all of the outstanding commercial paper and other senior debt supported by the pool, so that no cash flows from the underlying pool could be transferred to the other creditors until any liquidity draws were repaid in full. In such a case, the liquidity facility can be treated as a senior exposure. Otherwise, if these conditions are not satisfied, or if for other reasons the liquidity facility constitutes a mezzanine position in economic substance rather than a senior position in the underlying pool, the liquidity facility should be treated as a nonsenior exposure.\n",
      "18.19 | For risk-based capital purposes, the exposure amount of a securitization exposure is the sum of the on-balance sheet amount of the exposure, or carrying value – which takes into account purchase discounts and writedowns/specific provisions the bank took on this securitization exposure – and the off-balance sheet exposure amount, where applicable.\n",
      "18.20 | A bank must measure the exposure amount of its off-balance sheet securitization exposures as follows:\n",
      " | (1) | For credit risk mitigants sold or purchased by the bank, use the treatment set out in 18.56 to 18.62\n",
      " | (2) | For facilities that are not credit risk mitigants, use a credit conversion factor (CCF) of 100%. If contractually provided for, servicers may advance cash to ensure an uninterrupted flow of payments to investors so long as the servicer is entitled to full reimbursement and this right is senior to other claims on cash flows from the underlying pool of exposures. The undrawn portion of servicer cash advances or facilities may receive the CCF for unconditionally cancellable commitments under chapters 5 to 7 and;\n",
      " | (3) | For derivatives contracts other than credit risk derivatives contracts, such as interest rate or currency swaps sold or purchased by the bank, use the measurement approach set out in counterparty credit risk overview chapter of Minimum Capital Requirements for Counterparty Credit Risk and Credit Valuation Adjustment .\n",
      "18.21 | An SPE is a corporation, trust or other entity organized for a specific purpose, the activities of which are limited to those appropriate to accomplish the purpose of the SPE, and the structure of which is intended to isolate the SPE from the credit risk of an originator or seller of exposures. SPEs, normally a trust or similar entity, are commonly used as financing vehicles in which exposures are sold to the SPE in exchange for cash or other assets funded by debt issued by the trust.\n",
      "18.22 | For risk-based capital purposes, tranche maturity ( M T ) is the tranche’s remaining effective maturity in years and can be measured at the bank’s discretion in either of the following manners. In all cases, M T will have a floor of one year and a cap of five years.\n",
      " | (1) | As the euro 70 weighted-average maturity of the contractual cash flows of the tranche, as expressed below, where CF t denotes the cash flows (principal, interest payments and fees) contractually payable by the borrower in period t. The contractual payments must be unconditional and must not be dependent on the actual performance of the securitized assets. If such unconditional contractual payment dates are not available, the final legal maturity shall be used.\n",

      " | (2) | On the basis of final legal maturity of the tranche, where M L is the final legal maturity of the tranche.\n",
      " |  | \n",
      "18.23 | When determining the maturity of a securitization exposure, banks should take into account the maximum period of time they are exposed to potential losses from the securitized assets. In cases where a bank provides a commitment, the bank should calculate the maturity of the securitization exposure resulting from this commitment as the sum of the contractual maturity of the commitment and the longest maturity of the asset(s) to which the bank would be exposed after a draw has occurred. If those assets are revolving, the longest contractually possible remaining maturity of the asset that might be added during the revolving period would apply, rather than the (longest) maturity of the assets currently in the pool. The same treatment applies to all other instruments where the risk of the commitment/protection provider is not limited to losses realized until the maturity of that instrument (e.g. total return swaps). For credit protection instruments that are only exposed to losses that occur up to the maturity of that instrument, a bank would be allowed to apply the contractual maturity of the instrument and would not have to look through to the protected position.\n",

The exposures are legally isolated from the transferor in such a way (e.g. through the sale of assets or through sub-participation) that the exposures are put beyond the reach of the transferor and its creditors, even in bankruptcy or receivership. Banks should obtain legal opinion 71 that confirms true sale. The transferor’s retention of servicing rights to the exposures will not necessarily constitute indirect control of the exposures.

However, the bank may calculate risk-weighted assets for the liquidity facility as if it were expanded (either in order to cover defaulted assets or in terms of trigger events) to preclude all losses on the notes. In such a case, the bank would only need to calculate capital requirements on the liquidity facility.\n",

Where underwriting standards change, the originator should disclose the timing and purpose of such changes. Underwriting standards should not be less stringent than those applied to credit claims and receivables retained on the balance sheet. These should be credit claims or receivables which have satisfied materially nondeteriorating underwriting criteria and for which the obligors have been assessed as having the ability and volition to make timely payments on obligations; or on granular pools of obligors originated in the ordinary course of the originator’s business where expected cash flows have been modelled to meet stated obligations of the securitization under prudently stressed loan loss scenarios.\n",

Credit claims or receivables transferred to a securitization should satisfy clearly defined eligibility criteria. Credit claims or receivables transferred to a securitization after the closing date may not be actively selected, actively managed or otherwise cherry- picked on a discretionary basis.

To assist investors in conducting appropriate and ongoing monitoring of their investments’ performance and so that investors that wish to purchase a securitization in the secondary market have sufficient information to conduct appropriate due diligence, timely loan-level data in accordance with applicable laws or granular pool stratification data on the risk characteristics of the underlying pool and standardized investor reports should be readily available to current and potential investors at least quarterly throughout the life of the securitization. Cut-off dates of the loan-level or granular pool stratification data should be aligned with those used for investor reporting.

Only derivatives used for genuine hedging of asset and liability mismatches of interest rate and / or currency should be allowed.\n",
      " | (1) | For capital purposes, the term “appropriately mitigated” should be understood as not necessarily requiring a completely perfect hedge. The appropriateness of the mitigation of interest rate and foreign currency through the life of the transaction must be demonstrated by making available to potential investors, in a timely and regular manner, quantitative information including the fraction of notional amounts that are hedged, as well as sensitivity analysis that illustrates the effectiveness of the hedge under extreme but plausible scenarios.\n",

      "18.83 | To prevent investors being subjected to unexpected repayment profiles during the life of a securitization, the priorities of payments for all liabilities in all circumstances should be clearly defined at the time of securitization and appropriate legal comfort regarding their enforceability should be provided. To ensure that junior noteholders do not have inappropriate payment preference over senior noteholders that are due and payable, throughout the life of a securitization, or, where there are multiple securitizations backed by the same pool of credit claims or receivables, throughout the life of the securitization programme, junior liabilities should not have payment preference over senior liabilities which are due and payable. The securitization should not be structured as a “reverse” cash flow waterfall such that junior liabilities are paid where due and payable senior liabilities have not been paid. To help provide investors with full transparency over any changes to the cash flow waterfall, payment profile or priority of payments that might affect a securitization, all triggers affecting the cash flow waterfall, payment profile or priority of payments of the securitization should be clearly and fully disclosed both in offering documents and in investor reports, with information in the investor report that clearly identifies the breach status, the ability for the breach to be reversed and the consequences of the breach. Investor reports should contain information that allows investors to monitor the evolution over time of the indicators that are subject to triggers. Any triggers breached between payment dates should be disclosed to investors on a timely basis in accordance with the terms and conditions of all underlying transaction documents.\n",

Investors’ rights in the securitization should be clearly defined in all circumstances, including the rights of senior versus junior note holders.\n",

Final offering documents should be available from the closing date and all final underlying transaction documents shortly thereafter. These should be composed such that readers can readily find, understand and use relevant information. To ensure that all the securitization’s underlying documentation has been subject to appropriate review prior to publication, the terms and documentation of the securitization should be reviewed by an appropriately experienced third party legal practice, such as a legal counsel already instructed by one of the transaction parties, e.g. by the arranger or the trustee. Investors should be notified in a timely fashion of any changes in such documents that have an impact on the structural risks in the securitization.\n",

The party or parties with fiduciary responsibility to the securitization and to investors should be able to demonstrate sufficient skills and resources to comply with their duties of care in the administration of the securitization vehicle. To increase the likelihood that those identified as having a fiduciary responsibility towards investors as well as the servicer execute their duties in full on a timely basis, remuneration should be such that these parties are incentivized and able to meet their responsibilities in full and on a timely basis.\n",

Provisions should be documented for the replacement of servicers, bank account providers, derivatives counterparties and liquidity providers in the event of failure or non- performance or insolvency or other deterioration of creditworthiness of any such counterparty to the securitization. To enhance transparency and visibility over all receipts, payments and ledger entries at all times, the performance reports to investors should distinguish and report the securitization’s income and disbursements, such as scheduled principal, redemption principal, scheduled interest, prepaid principal, past due interest and fees and charges, delinquent, defaulted and restructured amounts under debt forgiveness and payment holidays, including accurate accounting for amounts attributable to principal and interest deficiency ledgers.\n",

      " | (8) | Transaction – An individual transaction in which the ABCP conduit holds a beneficial interest. A transaction may qualify as a securitization, but may also be a direct asset purchase, the acquisition of undivided interest in a replenishing pool of asset, a secured loan etc.\n",
      "18.97 | For exposures at the conduit level (e.g. exposure arising from investing in the commercial papers issued by the ABCP programme or sponsoring arrangements at the conduit/programme level), compliance with the short-term STC capital criteria is only achieved if the criteria are satisfied at both the conduit and transaction levels.\n",

      "18.99 | The sponsor should make representations and warranties to investors that the criterion set out in 18.100 below are met, and explain how this is the case on an overall basis. Only if specified should this be done for each transaction. Provided that each individual underlying transaction is homogeneous in terms of asset type, a conduit may be used to finance transactions of different asset types. Programme wide credit enhancement should not prevent a conduit from qualifying for STC, regardless of whether such enhancement technically creates resecuritisation.\n",

Credit claims or receivables underlying a transaction in a conduit should have contractually identified periodic payment streams relating to rental, 94 principal, interest, or principal and interest payments. Credit claims or receivables generating a single payment stream would equally qualify as eligible.

      " | (3) | Credit claims or receivables included in the securitization should have standard obligations, in terms of rights to payments and/or income from assets and that result in a periodic and well-defined stream of payments to investors. Credit card facilities should be deemed to result in a periodic and well-defined stream of payments to investors for the purposes of this criterion.\n",
      " | (4) | Repayment of the securitization exposure should mainly rely on the principal and interest proceeds from the securitized assets. Partial reliance on refinancing or re-sale of the asset securing the exposure may occur provided that re-financing is sufficiently distributed within the pool and the residual values on which the transaction relies are sufficiently low and that the reliance on refinancing is thus not substantial.\n",

The sponsor should ensure that the seller(s) and all other parties involved in the origination of the receivables have experience in originating same or similar assets, and are supported by a management with industry experience. For the purpose of meeting the short-term STC capital criteria, investors must request confirmation from the sponsor that the performance history of the originator and the original lender for substantially similar claims or receivables to those being securitized has been established for an \"appropriately long period of time”.

      " | (1) | To be eligible for risk-weighting purposes, the external credit assessment must take into account and reflect the entire amount of credit risk exposure the bank has with regard to all payments owed to it. For example, if a bank is owed both principal and interest, the assessment must fully take into account and reflect the credit risk associated with timely repayment of both principal and interest.\n",
      " | (2) | The external credit assessments must be from an eligible external credit assessment institution (ECAI) as recognized by SAMA in accordance with SAMA Circular No. BCS 242, Date: 11 April 2007 (Mapping of Credit Assessment Ratings Provided by Eligible External Credit Assessment Institution to Determine Risk Weighted Exposures) as outlined in chapter 8 with the following exception. In contrast with 8.3 (3) , an eligible credit assessment, procedures, methodologies, assumptions and the key elements underlying the assessments must be publicly available, on a non-selective basis and free of charge. 109 In other words, a rating must be published in an accessible form and included in the ECAI’s transition matrix. Also, loss and cash flow analysis as well as sensitivity of ratings to changes in the underlying rating assumptions should be publicly available. Consequently, ratings that are made available only to the parties to a transaction do not satisfy this requirement.\n",
      " | (3) | Eligible ECAIs must have a demonstrated expertise in assessing securitizations, which may be evidenced by strong market acceptance.\n",
      " | (4) | Where two or more eligible ECAIs can be used and these assess the credit risk of the same securitization exposure differently, paragraph 8.8 will apply.\n",
      " | (5) | Where credit risk mitigation (CRM) is provided to specific underlying exposures or the entire pool by an eligible guarantor as defined in chapter 9 and is reflected in the external credit assessment assigned to a securitization exposure(s), the risk weight associated with that external credit assessment should be used. In order to avoid any double-counting, no additional capital recognition is permitted. If the CRM provider is not recognized as an eligible guarantor under chapter 9 , the covered securitization exposures should be treated as unrated.\n",
      " | (6) | In the situation where a credit risk mitigant solely protects a specific securitization exposure within a given structure (e.g. asset-backed security tranche) and this protection is reflected in the external credit assessment, the bank must treat the exposure as if it is unrated and then apply the CRM treatment outlined in chapter 9 or in the foundation internal ratings-based (IRB) approach of chapters 10 to 16 , to recognize the hedge.\n",
      " | (7) | A bank is not permitted to use any external credit assessment for risk-weighting purposes where the assessment is at least partly based on unfunded support provided by the bank. For example, if a bank buys asset- backed commercial paper (ABCP) where it provides an unfunded securitization exposure extended to the ABCP programme (e.g. liquidity facility or credit enhancement), and that exposure plays a role in determining the credit assessment on the ABCP, the bank must treat the ABCP as if it were not rated. The bank must continue to hold capital against the other securitization exposures it provides (e.g. against the liquidity facility and/or credit enhancement).\n",

These requirements are intended to ensure that the unrated position is pari passu or senior in all respects to an externally-rated securitization exposure termed the “reference securitization exposure”.\n",
      "20.10 | The following operational requirements must be satisfied to recognize inferred ratings:\n",
      " | (1) | The reference securitization exposure (e.g. asset-backed security) must rank pari passu or be subordinate in all respects to the unrated securitization exposure. Credit enhancements, if any, must be taken into account when assessing the relative subordination of the unrated exposure and the reference securitization exposure. For example, if the reference securitization exposure benefits from any third-party guarantees or other credit enhancements that are not available to the unrated exposure, then the latter may not be assigned an inferred rating based on the reference securitization exposure.\n",
      " | (2) | The maturity of the reference securitization exposure must be equal to or longer than that of the unrated exposure.\n",
      " | (3) | On an ongoing basis, any inferred rating must be updated continuously to reflect any subordination of the unrated position or changes in the external rating of the reference securitization exposure.\n",

      " | (2) | The internal assessment of the credit quality of a securitization exposure to the ABCP programme must be based on ECAI criteria for the asset type purchased, and must be the equivalent of at least investment grade when initially assigned to an exposure. In addition, the internal assessment must be used in the bank's internal risk management processes, including management information and economic capital systems, and generally must meet all the relevant requirements of the IRB framework.\n",
      " | (3) | In order for banks to use the SEC-IAA, SAMA must be satisfied\n",
      " |  | (a) | That the ECAI meets the ECAI eligibility criteria outlined in chapter 8 and\n",
      " |  | (b) | With the ECAI rating methodologies used in the process.\n",
      " | (4) | Banks demonstrate to the satisfaction of SAMA how these internal assessments correspond to the relevant ECAI's standards. For instance, when calculating the credit enhancement level in the context of the SEC- IAA, SAMA may, if warranted, disallow on a full or partial basis any seller- provided recourse guarantees or excess spread, or any other first- loss credit enhancements that provide limited protection to the bank.\n",
      " | (5) | The bank's internal assessment process must identify gradations of risk. Internal assessments must correspond to the external ratings of ECAIs.\n",
      " | (6) | The bank's internal assessment process, particularly the stress factors for determining credit enhancement requirements, must be at least as conservative as the publicly available rating criteria of the major ECAIs that are externally rating the ABCP programme's commercial paper for the asset type being purchased by the programme. However, banks should consider, to some extent, all publicly available ECAI rating methodologies in developing their internal assessments.\n",
      " |  | (a) | In the case where the commercial paper issued by an ABCP programme is externally rated by two or more ECAIs and the different ECAIs' benchmark stress factors require different levels of credit enhancement to achieve the same external rating equivalent, the bank must apply the ECAI stress factor that requires the most conservative or highest level of credit protection. For example, if one ECAI required enhancement of 2.5 to 3.5 times historical losses for an asset type to obtain a single A rating equivalent and another required two to three times historical losses, the bank must use the higher range of stress factors in determining the appropriate level of seller-provided credit enhancement.\n",
      " |  | (b) | When selecting ECAIs to externally rate an ABCP, a bank must not choose only those ECAIs that generally have relatively less restrictive rating methodologies. In addition, if there are changes in the methodology of one of the selected ECAIs, including the stress factors, that adversely affect the external rating of the programme's commercial paper, then the revised rating methodology must be considered in evaluating whether the internal assessments assigned to ABCP programme exposures are in need of revision.\n",
      " |  | (c) | A bank cannot utilize an ECAI's rating methodology to derive an internal assessment if the ECAI's process or rating criteria are not publicly available. However, banks should consider the non-publicly available methodology - to the extent that they have access to such information -in developing their internal assessments, particularly if it is more conservative than the publicly available criteria.\n",
      " |  | (d) | In general, if the ECAI rating methodologies for an asset or exposure are not publicly available, then the IAA may not be used. However, in certain instances - for example, for new or uniquely structured transactions, which are not currently addressed by the rating criteria of an ECAI rating the programme's commercial paper - a bank may discuss the specific transaction with SAMA to determine whether the IAA may be applied to the related exposures.\n",
      " | (7) | Internal or external auditors, an ECAI, or the bank's internal credit review or risk management function must perform regular reviews of the internal assessment process and assess the validity of those internal assessments. If the bank's internal audit, credit review or risk management functions perform the reviews of the internal assessment process, then these functions must be independent of the ABCP programme business line, as well as the underlying customer relationships.\n",
      " | (8) | The bank must track the performance of its internal assessments over time to evaluate the performance of the assigned internal assessments and make adjustments, as necessary, to its assessment process when the performance of the exposures routinely diverges from the assigned internal assessments on those exposures.\n",
      " | (9) | The ABCP programme must have credit and investment guidelines, i.e. underwriting standards, for the ABCP programme. In the consideration of an asset purchase, the ABCP programme (i.e. the programme administrator) should develop an outline of the structure of the purchase transaction. Factors that should be discussed include the type of asset being purchased; type and monetary value of the exposures arising from the provision of liquidity facilities and credit enhancements; loss waterfall; and legal and economic isolation of the transferred assets from the entity selling the assets.\n",
      " | (10) | A credit analysis of the asset seller's risk profile must be performed and should consider, for example, past and expected future financial performance; current market position; expected future competitiveness; leverage, cash flow and interest coverage; and debt rating. In addition, a review of the seller's underwriting standards, servicing capabilities and collection processes should be performed.\n",
      " | (11) | The ABCP programme's underwriting policy must establish minimum asset eligibility criteria that, among other things:\n",
      " |  | (a) | Exclude the purchase of assets that are significantly past due or defaulted;\n",
      " |  | (b) | Limit excess concentration to individual obligor or geographical area; and\n",
      " |  | (c) | Limit the tenor of the assets to be purchased.\n",
      " | (12) | The ABCP programme should have collection processes established that consider the operational capability and credit quality of the servicer. The programme should mitigate to the extent possible seller/servicer risk through various methods, such as triggers based on current credit quality that would preclude commingling of funds and impose lockbox arrangements that would help ensure the continuity of payments to the ABCP programme.\n",
      " | (13) | The aggregate estimate of loss on an asset pool that the ABCP programme is considering purchasing must consider all sources of potential risk, such as credit and dilution risk. If the seller-provided credit enhancement is sized based on only credit-related losses, then a separate reserve should be established for dilution risk, if dilution risk is material for the particular exposure pool. In addition, in sizing the required enhancement level, the bank should review several years of historical information, including losses, delinquencies, dilutions and the turnover rate of the receivables. Furthermore, the bank should evaluate the characteristics of the underlying asset pool (e.g. weighted-average credit score) and should identify any concentrations to an individual obligor or geographical region and the granularity of the asset pool.\n",
      " | (14) | The ABCP programme must incorporate structural features into the purchase of assets in order to mitigate potential credit deterioration of the underlying portfolio. Such features may include wind-down triggers specific to a pool of exposures.\n",
      "21.3 | The exposure amount of the securitization exposure to the ABCP programme must be assigned to the risk weight in the SEC-ERBA appropriate to the credit rating equivalent assigned to the bank's exposure.\n",
      "21.4 | If a bank's internal assessment process is no longer considered adequate, SAMA may preclude the bank from applying the SEC-IAA to its ABCP exposures, both existing and newly originated, for determining the appropriate capital treatment until the bank has remedied the deficiencies. In this instance, the bank must revert to the SEC-SA described in 19.1 to 19.15 .\n",

      "22.1 | To calculate capital requirements for a securitization exposure to an internal ratings-based (IRB) pool, a bank must use the securitization internal ratings- based approach (SEC-IRBA) and the following bank-supplied inputs: the IRB capital charge had the underlying exposures not been securitized (K IRB ), the tranche attachment point (A), the tranche detachment point (D) and the supervisory parameter p, as defined below.

This calculation should reflect the effects of any credit risk mitigant that is applied on the underlying exposures (either individually or to the entire pool), and hence benefits all of the securitization exposures.\n",
      "22.4 | For structures involving a special purpose entity (SPE), all of the SPE's exposures related to the securitization are to be treated as exposures in the pool. Exposures related to the securitization that should be treated as exposures in the pool could include assets in which the SPE may have invested a reserve account, such as a cash collateral account or claims against counterparties resulting from interest swaps or currency swaps. 112 Notwithstanding, the bank can exclude the SPE's exposures from the pool for capital calculation purposes if the bank can demonstrate to SAMA that the risk of the SPE's exposures is immaterial (for example, because it has been mitigated 113 ) or that it does not affect the bank's securitization exposure.\n",
      "22.5 | In the case of funded synthetic securitizations, any proceeds of the issuances of credit-linked notes or other funded obligations of the SPE that serve as collateral for the repayment of the securitization exposure in question and for which the bank cannot demonstrate to SAMA that it is immaterial must be included in the calculation of K IRB if the default risk of the collateral is subject to the tranched loss allocation. 114\n",

      " | (1) | The requirement in paragraph 10.30 for the bank to have a claim on all proceeds from the pool of receivables or a pro-rata interest in the proceeds does not apply. Instead, the bank must have a claim on all proceeds from the pool of securitized exposures that have been allocated to the bank's exposure in the securitization in accordance with the terms of the related securitization documentation;\n",

Specifically, requirements for effective control and ownership must be met for all proceeds from the pool of securitized exposures that have been allocated to the bank's exposure to the securitization.

      "23.1 | A non-performing loan securitization (NPL securitization) means a securitization where the underlying pool's variable W, as defined in 19.6 , is equal to or higher than 90% at the origination cut-off date and at any subsequent date on which assets are added to or removed from the underlying pool due to replenishment, restructuring or any other relevant reason. The underlying pool of exposures of an NPL securitization may only comprise loans, loan-equivalent financial instruments or tradable instruments used for the sole purpose of loan sub-participation as referred to in 18.24 (2) . Loan-equivalent financial instruments include, for example, bonds not listed on a trading venue. For the avoidance of doubt, an NPL securitization may not be backed by exposures to other securitizations.\n",
      "23.2 | SAMA may provide for a stricter definition of NPL securitizations than that laid out in 23.1 above. For these purposes, SAMA may:\n",
      " | (1) | Raise the minimum level of W to a level higher than 90%; or\n",
      " | (2) | Require that the non-delinquent exposures in the underlying pool comply with a set of minimum criteria, or preclude certain types of non-delinquent exposures from forming part of the underlying pools of NPL securitizations.\n",
      "23.3 | A bank is precluded from applying the SEC-IRBA to an exposure to an NPL securitization where the bank uses the foundation approach as referred to in 10.35 to calculate the KIRB of the underlying pool of exposures.\n",
      "23.4 | The risk weight applicable to exposures to NPL securitizations according to Internal ratings-based approach (SEC-IRBA) set out in chapter 22 , Standardized approach (SEC-SA) outlined in chapter 19 , or the look-through approach in 24718.50 is floored at 100%.\n",
      "23.5 | Where, according to the hierarchy of approaches in 18.41 to 18.47 , the bank must use the SEC-IRBA or the SEC-SA, a bank may apply a risk weight of 100% to the senior tranche of an NPL securitization provided that the NPL securitization is a traditional securitization and the sum of the non- refundable purchase price discounts (NRPPD), calculated as described in 23.6 below, is equal to or higher than 50% of the outstanding balance of the pool of exposures.\n",
      "23.6 | For the purposes of 23.5, NRPPD is the difference between the outstanding balance of the exposures in the underlying pool and the price at which these exposures are sold by the originator to the securitization entity, when neither originator nor the original lender are reimbursed for this difference. In cases where the originator underwrites tranches of the NPL securitization for subsequent sale, the NRPPD may include the differences between the nominal amount of the tranches and the price at which these tranches are first sold to unrelated third parties. For any given piece of a securitization tranche, only its initial sale from the originator to investors is taken into account in the determination of NRPPD. The purchase prices of subsequent re-sales are not considered.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "24.1 | Equity investments in funds that are held in the banking book must be treated in a manner consistent with one or more of the following three approaches, which vary in their risk sensitivity and conservatism: the “look-through approach” (LTA), the “mandate-based approach” (MBA), and the “fall-back approach” (FBA). The requirements set out in this chapter apply to banks’ equity investments in all types of funds, including off-balance sheet exposures (e.g. unfunded commitments to subscribe to a fund’s future capital calls). Exposures, including underlying exposures held by funds, that are required to be deducted according to the Regulatory Capital Under Basel III Framework ( SAMA Circular No. 341000015689, Date: 19 December 2012 ) are excluded from the risk weighting treatment outlined in this chapter.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.2 | The LTA requires a bank to risk weight the underlying exposures of a fund as if the exposures were held directly by the bank. This is the most granular and risk-sensitive approach. It must be used when:\n",
      " | (1) | There is sufficient and frequent information provided to the bank regarding the underlying exposures of the fund; and\n",
      " | (2) | Such information is verified by an independent third party.\n",
      "24.3 | To satisfy condition (1) above, the frequency of financial reporting of the fund must be the same as, or more frequent than, that of the bank’s and the granularity of the financial information must be sufficient to calculate the corresponding risk weights. To satisfy condition (2) above, there must be verification of the underlying exposures by an independent third party, such as the depository or the custodian bank or, where applicable, the management company. 115\n",
      "24.4 | Under the LTA banks must risk weight all underlying exposures of the fund as if those exposures were directly held. This includes, for example, any underlying exposure arising from the fund’s derivatives activities for situations in which the underlying receives a risk weighting treatment under the calculation of minimum risk based capital requirements and the associated counterparty credit risk (CCR) exposure. Instead of determining a credit valuation adjustment (CVA) charge associated with the fund’s derivatives exposures in accordance with the Minimum Capital Requirements for CVA, banks must multiply the CCR exposure by a factor of 1.5 before applying the risk weight associated with the counterparty. 116\n",
      "24.5 | Banks may rely on third-party calculations for determining the risk weights associated with their equity investments in funds (i.e. the underlying risk weights of the exposures of the fund) if they do not have adequate data or information to perform the calculations themselves. In such cases, the applicable risk weight shall be 1.2 times higher than the one that would be applicable if the exposure were held directly by the bank. 117\n",
      "\n",
      "24.6 | The second approach, the MBA, provides a method for calculating regulatory capital that can be used when the conditions for applying the LTA are not met.\n",
      "24.7 | Under the MBA, banks may use the information contained in a fund's mandate or in the national regulations governing such investment funds. 118 To ensure that all underlying risks are taken into account (including CCR) and that the MBA renders capital requirements no less than the LTA, the risk- weighted assets for the fund's exposures are calculated as the sum of the following three items :\n",
      " | (1) | Balance sheet exposures (i.e. the funds' assets) are risk weighted assuming the underlying portfolios are invested to the maximum extent allowed under the fund's mandate in those assets attracting the highest capital requirements, and then progressively in those other assets implying lower capital requirements. If more than one risk weight can be applied to a given exposure, the maximum risk weight applicable must be used. 119\n",
      " | (2) | Whenever the underlying risk of a derivative exposure or an off-balance-sheet item receives a risk weighting treatment under the risk-based capital requirements standards, the notional amount of the derivative position or of the off-balance sheet exposure is risk weighted accordingly. 120 121\n",
      " | (3) | The CCR associated with the fund's derivative exposures is calculated using the standardized approach to counterparty credit risk (S A-CC R, see standardized approach for counterparty credit risk ). SA-CCR calculates the counterparty credit risk exposure of a netting set of derivatives by multiplying (i) the sum of the replacement cost and potential future exposure; by (ii) an alpha factor set at 1.4. Whenever the replacement cost is unknown, the exposure measure for CCR will be calculated in a conservative manner by using the sum of the notional amounts of the derivatives in the netting set as a proxy for the replacement cost, and the multiplier used in the calculation of the potential future exposure will be equal to 1. Whenever the potential future exposure is unknown, it will be calculated as 15% of the sum of the notional values of the derivatives in the netting set. 122 The risk weight associated with the counterparty is applied to the counterparty credit risk exposure. Instead of determining a CVA charge associated with the fund's derivative exposures in accordance with the Minimum Capital Requirements for CVA, banks must multiply the CCR exposure by a factor of 1.5 before applying the risk weight associated with the counterparty. 123\n",
      "\n",
      "24.8 | Where neither the LTA nor the MBA is feasible, banks are required to apply the FBA. The FBA applies a 1250% risk weight to the bank’s equity investment in the fund.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.9 | When a bank has an investment in a fund (e.g. Fund A) that itself has an investment in another fund (e.g. Fund B), which the bank identified by using either the LTA or the MBA, the risk weight applied to the investment of the first fund (i.e. Fund A’s investment in Fund B) can be determined by using one of the three approaches set out above. For all subsequent layers (e.g. Fund B’s investments in Fund C and so forth), the risk weights applied to an investment in another fund (Fund C) can be determined by using the LTA under the condition that the LTA was also used for determining the risk weight for the investment in the fund at the previous layer (Fund B). Otherwise, the FBA must be applied.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.10 | A bank may use a combination of the three approaches when determining the capital requirements for an equity investment in an individual fund, provided that the conditions set out in paragraphs 24.1 to 24.12 are met.\n",
      "\n",
      "24.11 | Leverage is defined as the ratio of total assets to total equity. Leverage is taken into account in the MBA by using the maximum financial leverage permitted in the fund’s mandate or in the national regulation governing the fund.\n",
      "24.12 | When determining the capital requirement related to its equity investment in a fund, a bank must apply a leverage adjustment to the average risk weight of the fund, as set out in 24.13, subject to a cap of 1250%.\n",
      "24.13 | After calculating the total risk-weighted assets of the fund according to the LTA or the MBA, banks will calculate the average risk weight of the fund (Avg RWfund) by dividing the total risk-weighted assets by the total assets of the fund.\n",
      " | Using Avg RWfund and taking into account the leverage of a fund (Lvg), the risk- weighted assets for a bank’s equity investment in a fund can be represented as follows:\n",
      " | RWAinvestment = Avg RWfund * Lvg * equity investment\n",
      "24.14 | The effect of the leverage adjustments depends on the underlying riskiness of the portfolio (i.e. the average risk weight) as obtained by applying the standardized approach or the IRB approaches for credit risk. The formula can therefore be re- written as:\n",
      " | RWAinvestment = RWAfund * percentage of shares\n",
      "\n",
      "24.15 | Equity investments in funds that are held in the banking book must be treated in a consistent manner based on 24.1 to 24.14 , as adjusted by 24.16 to 24.17. | \n",
      "24.16 | Under the LTA: | \n",
      " | (1) | Banks using an IRB approach must calculate the IRB risk components (i.e. PD of the underlying exposures and, where applicable, LGD and EAD) associated with the fund’s underlying exposures (except where the underlying exposures are equity exposures, in respect of which the standardized approach must be used as required by 10.34 ).\n",
      " | (2) | Banks using an IRB approach may use the standardized approach for credit risk ( chapter 7 ) when applying risk weights to the underlying components of funds if they are permitted to do so under the provisions relating to the adoption of the IRB approach set out in chapter 10 in the case of directly held investments. In addition, when an IRB calculation is not feasible(e.g. the bank cannot assign the necessary risk components to the underlying exposures in a manner consistent with its own underwriting criteria), the methods set out in 24.17 below must be used.\n",
      " | (3) | Banks may rely on third-party calculations for determining the risk weights associated with their equity investments in funds (i.e. the underlying risk weights of the exposures of the fund) if they do not have adequate data or information to perform the calculations themselves. In this case, the third party must use the methods set out in 24.17 below, with the applicable risk weight set 1.2 times higher than the one that would be applicable if the exposure were held directly by the bank.\n",
      "24.17 | In cases when the IRB calculation is not feasible (24.16 (2) above), a third-party is performing the calculation of risk weights (24.16 (3) above) or when the bank is using the MBA the following methods must be used to determine the risk weights associated with the fund’s underlying exposures:\n",
      " | (1) | For securitization exposures, the Securitization External-ratings-based approach (SEC-ERBA) set out in chapter 20 ; the Standardized approach (SEC-SA) set out in chapter 19 , if the bank is not able to use the SECERBA; or a 1250% risk weight where the specified requirements for using the SEC-ERBA or SEC-SA are not met; and\n",

      "Delivery-versus-payment transactions\n",
      "25.3 | Transactions settled through a delivery-versus-payment system (DvP), 124 providing simultaneous exchanges of securities for cash, expose firms to a risk of loss on the difference between the transaction valued at the agreed settlement price and the transaction valued at current market price (i.e. positive current exposure). Banks must calculate a capital requirement for such exposures if the payments have not yet taken place five business days after the settlement date, see paragraph 25.9 below.\n",

Banks that have made the first contractual payment/delivery leg must calculate a capital requirement for the exposure if the second leg has not been received by the end of the business day. The requirement increases if the second leg has not been received within five business days. See paragraphs 25.10 to 25.12\n",

The treatment does not apply to the instruments that are subject to the counterparty credit risk requirements set out in the Minimum Capital Requirements for Counterparty Credit Risk (CCR) and Credit Valuation Adjustment (CVA) (i.e. over-the-counter derivatives, exchange- traded derivatives, long settlement transactions, securities financing transactions).\n",

      "\n",

Banks using the Advanced IRB approach may use a 45% loss-given- default (LGD) in lieu of estimating LGDs so long as they apply it to all failed trade exposures. Alternatively, banks using the IRB approach may opt to apply the standardized approach risk weights applicable to the counterparty set out in chapter 7 .\n",

Availability payments are sized to cover operating and maintenance costs, debt service costs and equity returns as the project finance entity operates the project. Availability payments are not subject to swings in demand, such as traffic levels, and are adjusted typically only for lack of performance or lack of availability of the asset to the public\n",
      "Subordinated Debt, Equity and Other Capital Instruments\n",
      "12 Indirect equity interests include holdings of derivative instruments tied to equity interests, and holdings in corporations, partnerships, limited liability companies or other types of enterprises that issue ownership interests and are engaged principally in the business of investing in equity instruments. 13 For certain obligations that require or permit settlement by issuance of a variable number of the issuer’s equity shares, the change in the monetary value of the obligation is equal to the change in the fair value of a fixed number of equity shares multiplied by a specified factor. Those obligations meet the conditions of item (c) if both the factor and the referenced number of shares are fixed. For example, an issuer may be required to settle an obligation by issuing shares with a value equal to three times the appreciation in the fair value of 1,000 equity shares. That obligation is considered to be the same as an obligation that requires settlement by issuance of shares equal to the appreciation in the fair value of 3,000 equity shares. 14 Equities that are recorded as a loan but arise from a debt/equity swap made as part of the orderly realization or restructuring of the debt are included in the definition of equity holdings. However, these instruments may not attract a lower capital charge than would apply if the holdings remained in the debt portfolio. 15 SAMA may decide not to require that such liabilities be included where they are directly hedged by an equity holding, such that the net position does not involve material risk. 16 SAMA may consider to re-characterize debt holdings as equites for regulatory purposes and to otherwise ensure the proper treatment of holdings under the supervisory review process. 17 For example, investments in unlisted equities of corporate clients with which the bank has or intends to establish a long-term business relationship and debt-equity swaps for corporate restructuring purposes would be excluded.\n",
      "Retail Exposure Class\n",
      "18 Aggregated exposure means gross amount (i.e. not taking any credit risk mitigation into account) of all forms of retail exposures, excluding residential real estate exposures. In case of off-balance sheet claims, the gross amount would be calculated after applying credit conversion factors. In addition, “to one counterparty” means one or several entities that may be considered as a single beneficiary (e.g. in the case of a small business that is affiliated to another small business, the limit would apply to the bank’s aggregated exposure on both businesses). 19 To apply the 0.2% threshold of the granularity criterion, banks must: first, identify the full set of exposures in the retail exposure class (as defined in paragraph 7.55); second, identify the subset of exposure that meet product criterion and do not exceed the threshold for the value of aggregated exposures to one counterparty (as defined in paragraph 7.57); and third, exclude any exposures that have a value greater than 0.2% of the subset before exclusions\n",
      "Real Estate Exposure Class\n",
      "20 Please refer to Art 24, the ‘Registered Real Estate Mortgage’s Law issued via Royal Decree No. M/49 dated 03/07/2012 . 21 Likewise, this would apply to junior liens held by the same bank that holds the senior lien in case there is an intermediate lien from another bank (i.e. the senior and junior liens held by the bank are not in sequential ranking order 22 Metrics and levels for measuring the ability to repay should mirror the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Principles for sound residential mortgage underwriting practices (April 2012). 23 If a bank grants different loans secured by the same property and they are sequential in ranking order (i.e. there is no intermediate lien from another bank), the different loans should be considered as a single exposure for risk-weighting purposes, and the amount of the loans should be added to calculate the LTV 24 The loan amount of the junior liens must include all other loans secured with liens of equal or higher ranking than the bank’s lien securing the loan for purposes of defining the LTV bucket and risk weight for the junior lien. If there is insufficient information for ascertaining the ranking of the other liens, the bank should assume that these liens rank pari passu with the junior lien held by the bank. This treatment does not apply to exposures that are risk weighted according to the loan splitting approach (paragraphs 7.75 and 7.78), where the junior lien would be taken into account in the calculation of the value of the property. The bank will first determine the “base” risk weight based on Tables 9, 10, 11 or 12 as applicable and adjust the “base” risk weight by a multiplier of 1.25, for application to the loan amount of the junior lien. If the “base” risk weight corresponds to the lowest LTV bucket, the multiplier will not be applied. The resulting risk weight of multiplying the “base” risk weight by 1.25 will be capped at the risk weight applied to the exposure when the requirements in paragraph 7.63 are not met. 25 The valuation must be done independently from the bank’s mortgage acquisition, loan processing and loan decision process. 26 In the case where the mortgage loan is financing the purchase of the property, the value of the property for LTV purposes will not be higher than the effective purchase price. 27 A bank’s use of mortgage insurance should mirror the FSB Principles for sound residential mortgage underwriting (April 2012). 28 For residential property under construction described in paragraph 7.63(1), this means there should be an expectation that the property will satisfy all applicable laws and regulations enabling the property to be occupied for housing purposes. 29 For example, for a loan of SAR 70,000 to an individual secured on a property valued at SAR 100,000, the bank will apply a risk weight of 20% to SAR 55,000 of the exposure and, according to paragraph 7.82(1), a risk weight of 75% to the residual exposure of SAR 15,000. This gives total risk weighted assets for the exposure of SAR 22,250 = (0.20 * SAR 55,000) + (0.75 * SAR 15,000). 30 Where there are liens on the property that are not held by the bank, the part of the exposure up to 55% of the property value should be reduced by the amount of the senior liens not held by the bank and by a pro-rata percentage of any liens pari passu with the bank’s lien but not held by the bank. See paragraph 7.75 for examples of how this methodology applies in the case of residential retail exposures. 31 ADC exposures do not include the acquisition of forest or desert or agricultural land, where there is no planning consent or intention to apply for planning consent.\n",

      "32 Certain arrangements might be exempted from the definition of commitments provided that the following conditions are met: (i) the bank receives no fees or commissions to establish or maintain the arrangements; (ii) the client is required to apply to the bank for the initial and each subsequent drawdown; (iii) the bank has full authority, regardless of the fulfilment by the client of the conditions set out in the facility documentation, over the execution of each drawdown; and (iv) the bank’s decision on the execution of each drawdown is only made after assessing the creditworthiness of the client immediately prior to drawdown. Exempted arrangements that meet the above criteria are limited to certain arrangements for corporates and MSMEs, where counterparties are closely monitored on an ongoing basis. 33 These items are to be weighted according to the type of asset and not according to the type of counterparty with whom the transaction has been entered into. 34 These items are to be weighted according to the type of asset and not according to the type of counterparty with whom the transaction has been entered into. 35 For example, if a bank has a commitment to open short-term self- liquidating trade letters of credit arising from the movement of goods, a 20% CCF will be applied (instead of a 40% CCF); and if a bank has an unconditionally cancellable commitment described in paragraph 7.92 to issue direct credit substitutes, a 10% CCF will be applied (instead of a 100% CCF).\n",

To qualify, MDBs must have preferred creditor status recognized in the market and be included in the first footnote in paragraph 7.9 . In such cases, for risk- weighting purposes, the borrower’s domestic currency rating may be used instead of its foreign currency rating. In the case of a guarantee against convertibility and transfer risk, the local currency rating can be used only for the portion that has been guaranteed. The portion of the loan not benefiting from such a guarantee will be risk-weighted based on the foreign currency rating. 37 The notations follow the methodology used by S&P and by Moody’s Investors Service. The A-1 rating of S&P includes both A-1+ and A-1–. 38 The “others” category includes all non-prime and B or C ratings.\n",

      "126 For the sake of simplicity, the possibility described in paragraph 14.8 of Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Risk to set M Dilution = 1 is not used in this example. 127 The rounding of the maturity calculation is shown for example purposes 128 As described in paragraph 14.5 of Minimum Capital Requirements for Credit Risk, when calculating the default risk of exposures with non-immaterial dilution risk “EAD will be calculated as the outstanding amount minus the capital requirement for dilution prior to credit risk mitigation”. 129 For the sake of simplicity, it is assumed that the second-loss guarantee is cash-collateralised 130 Subject to the condition that it is not already being used for realised dilution losses. 131 Subject to the condition that it is not already being used for realised default losses. 132 In this example, the purchase price discount was recognised in the default risk calculation, but banks could also choose to use it for the dilution risk calculation. It is also assumed that the second-loss dilution guarantee explicitly covers dilution losses above €50,000 up to €300,000. If the guarantee instead covered €250,000 dilution losses after the purchase discount has been depleted (irrespective of whether the purchase discount has been used for dilution or default losses), then the senior note holder should assume that he is exposed to dilution losses from €250,000 up to €1,000,000 (instead of €0 to €50,000 + €300,000 to €1,000,000). 133 The correct application of the overall risk weight floor is such that the intermediate results (in this case the risk weight for Tranche A*) are calculated without the floor and the floor is only enforced in the last step (ie Step 3(b)).\n",

      "  • 1.2 | This revised framework in risk-weighted assets for credit risk is issued by SAMA in exercise of the authority vested in SAMA under the Charter issued via Royal Decree No. M/36 dated 11/04/1442H , and the Banking Control Law issued 01/01/1386H .\n",
      "  • 1.3 | This revised framework on risk-weighted assets for credit risk will supersede the following existing requirements related to the calculation of RWAs for credit risk:\n",
      "  • 2.1 | This framework applies to all domestic banks both on a consolidated basis, which include all branches and subsidiaries, and on a standalone basis.\n",
      "  • 2.2 | This framework is not applicable to foreign banks’ branches operating in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the branches shall comply with the regulatory capital requirements stipulated by their respective home regulators.\n",
      "  • 5.1 | Banks can choose between two broad methodologies for calculating their risk-based capital requirements for credit risk. The first is the standardized approach, which is set out in chapters 6 to 9 : |\n",
      "  • 5.2 | The second risk-weighted assets approach is the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, which allows banks to use their internal rating systems for credit risk. The IRB approach is set out in chapters 10 to 16 . Banks must seek SAMA’s regulatory approval before they can use the IRB Approach for calculation of capital requirements for credit risk, subject to the Bank meeting all minimum requirements for the use of IRB Approach, supervisory review and validation exercise as may be carried out by SAMA. |\n",
      "  • 5.3 | This policy document also covers the treatment in banking book of the following exposures: |\n",
      "  • 6.1 | Banks must perform due diligence to ensure that they have an adequate understanding, at origination and thereafter on a regular basis (at least annually), of the risk profile and characteristics of their counterparties. In cases where ratings are used, due diligence is necessary to assess the risk of the exposure for risk management purposes and whether the risk weight applied is appropriate and prudent. The sophistication of the due diligence should be appropriate to the size and complexity of banks’ activities. Banks must take reasonable and adequate steps to assess the operating and financial performance levels and trends through internal credit analysis and/or other analytics outsourced to a third party, as appropriate for each counterparty. Banks must be able to access information about their counterparties on a regular basis to complete due diligence analyses.\n",
      "  • 6.2 | For exposures to entities belonging to consolidated groups, due diligence should, to the extent possible, be performed at the solo entity level to which there is a credit exposure. In evaluating the repayment capacity of the solo entity, banks are expected to take into account the support of the group and the potential for it to be adversely impacted by problems in the group.\n",

      "  • 1.1 | The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the Basel III: Finalizing post-crisis reforms in December 2017, which includes among others, the revised framework for Credit Risk aimed to enhance the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches, balances simplicity of the framework and, comparability in the calculation of risk weighted assets (RWAs) for credit risk using different available approaches.\n",
      "  • 1.2 | This revised framework in risk-weighted assets for credit risk is issued by SAMA in exercise of the authority vested in SAMA under the Charter issued via Royal Decree No. M/36 dated 11/04/1442H , and the Banking Control Law issued 01/01/1386H .\n",
      "  • 1.3 | This revised framework on risk-weighted assets for credit risk will supersede the following existing requirements related to the calculation of RWAs for credit risk:\n",
      "  • 2.1 | This framework applies to all domestic banks both on a consolidated basis, which include all branches and subsidiaries, and on a standalone basis.\n",
      "  • 2.2 | This framework is not applicable to foreign banks’ branches operating in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the branches shall comply with the regulatory capital requirements stipulated by their respective home regulators.\n",
      "  • 5.1 | Banks can choose between two broad methodologies for calculating their risk-based capital requirements for credit risk. The first is the standardized approach, which is set out in chapters 6 to 9 : |\n",
      "  • 5.2 | The second risk-weighted assets approach is the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, which allows banks to use their internal rating systems for credit risk. The IRB approach is set out in chapters 10 to 16 . Banks must seek SAMA’s regulatory approval before they can use the IRB Approach for calculation of capital requirements for credit risk, subject to the Bank meeting all minimum requirements for the use of IRB Approach, supervisory review and validation exercise as may be carried out by SAMA. |\n",
      "  • 5.3 | This policy document also covers the treatment in banking book of the following exposures: |\n",
      "  • 6.1 | Banks must perform due diligence to ensure that they have an adequate understanding, at origination and thereafter on a regular basis (at least annually), of the risk profile and characteristics of their counterparties. In cases where ratings are used, due diligence is necessary to assess the risk of the exposure for risk management purposes and whether the risk weight applied is appropriate and prudent. The sophistication of the due diligence should be appropriate to the size and complexity of banks’ activities. Banks must take reasonable and adequate steps to assess the operating and financial performance levels and trends through internal credit analysis and/or other analytics outsourced to a third party, as appropriate for each counterparty. Banks must be able to access information about their counterparties on a regular basis to complete due diligence analyses.\n",
      "  • 6.2 | For exposures to entities belonging to consolidated groups, due diligence should, to the extent possible, be performed at the solo entity level to which there is a credit exposure. In evaluating the repayment capacity of the solo entity, banks are expected to take into account the support of the group and the potential for it to be adversely impacted by problems in the group.\n",

      "  • 1.1 | The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued the Basel III: Finalizing post-crisis reforms in December 2017, which includes among others, the revised framework for Credit Risk aimed to enhance the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches, balances simplicity of the framework and, comparability in the calculation of risk weighted assets (RWAs) for credit risk using different available approaches.\n",
      "  • 1.2 | This revised framework in risk-weighted assets for credit risk is issued by SAMA in exercise of the authority vested in SAMA under the Charter issued via Royal Decree No. M/36 dated 11/04/1442H , and the Banking Control Law issued 01/01/1386H .\n",
      "  • 1.3 | This revised framework on risk-weighted assets for credit risk will supersede the following existing requirements related to the calculation of RWAs for credit risk:\n",
      "  • 2.1 | This framework applies to all domestic banks both on a consolidated basis, which include all branches and subsidiaries, and on a standalone basis.\n",
      "  • 2.2 | This framework is not applicable to foreign banks’ branches operating in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, and the branches shall comply with the regulatory capital requirements stipulated by their respective home regulators.\n",
      "  • 5.1 | Banks can choose between two broad methodologies for calculating their risk-based capital requirements for credit risk. The first is the standardized approach, which is set out in chapters 6 to 9 : |\n",
      "  • 5.2 | The second risk-weighted assets approach is the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach, which allows banks to use their internal rating systems for credit risk. The IRB approach is set out in chapters 10 to 16 . Banks must seek SAMA’s regulatory approval before they can use the IRB Approach for calculation of capital requirements for credit risk, subject to the Bank meeting all minimum requirements for the use of IRB Approach, supervisory review and validation exercise as may be carried out by SAMA. |\n",
      "  • 5.3 | This policy document also covers the treatment in banking book of the following exposures: |\n",
      "  • 6.1 | Banks must perform due diligence to ensure that they have an adequate understanding, at origination and thereafter on a regular basis (at least annually), of the risk profile and characteristics of their counterparties. In cases where ratings are used, due diligence is necessary to assess the risk of the exposure for risk management purposes and whether the risk weight applied is appropriate and prudent. The sophistication of the due diligence should be appropriate to the size and complexity of banks’ activities. Banks must take reasonable and adequate steps to assess the operating and financial performance levels and trends through internal credit analysis and/or other analytics outsourced to a third party, as appropriate for each counterparty. Banks must be able to access information about their counterparties on a regular basis to complete due diligence analyses.\n",
      "  • 6.2 | For exposures to entities belonging to consolidated groups, due diligence should, to the extent possible, be performed at the solo entity level to which there is a credit exposure. In evaluating the repayment capacity of the solo entity, banks are expected to take into account the support of the group and the potential for it to be adversely impacted by problems in the group.\n",
