1. Introduction: 

Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a document on Basel III: Finalizing post-crisis reforms in December 2017. Which includes the revised disclosure requirements that aims to enhance transparency by setting the minimum requirements for market disclosures of information on the risk management practices and capital adequacy of banks. This will enable market participants to obtain key information on risk exposures, risk management framework, adequacy of regulatory capital of banks, reduces information asymmetry and helps promote comparability of banks' risk profiles within and across jurisdictions. In addition, banks' Pillar 3 disclosure will also facilitate supervisory monitoring while strengthening incentives for banks to implement robust risk management. 

Among the key revisions to the Pillar 3 framework include disclosure requirements related to: 

a) Credit risk, operational risk, the leverage ratio and credit valuation adjustment 

(CVA) risk; 

b) Risk-weighted assets (RWAs) as calculated by the bank's internal models and 

according to the standardised approaches; 

c) Disclosures related to the revised market risk framework 

d) Overview of risk management framework, RWAs and key prudential metrics; 

and 

e) Asset encumbrance; and 

f) Capital distribution constraints 

This framework is issued by SAMA in exercise of the authority vested in SAMA under the Central Bank Law issued via Royal Decree No. M/36 dated 11/04/1442H, and the Banking Control Law issued 01/01/1386H. 

This framework supersedes all circulars/instructions/rules related to Pillar 3 Disclosure Requirements previously issued by SAMA.

2. Scope of application: 

2.1 Disclosure requirements are an integral part of the Basel framework. Unless otherwise stated, the Tables and Templates are applicable to all domestic banks both on a consolidated basis, which include all branches and subsidiaries, and on a standalone basis. 

2.2 This framework is not applicable to Foreign Banks Branches operating in the 

kingdom of Saudi Arabia. 

2.3 Banks must assess the applicability of the disclosure requirements based on their 

specific compliance obligations. 

3. Implementation dates: 

3.1 Disclosure requirements will be effective on 01 January 2023. 

3.2 Disclosure requirements are applicable for Pillar 3 reports related to fiscal periods that include or come after the specific calendar implementation date which means that the first set of templates/tables will cover data as at March 31, 2023. 

4. Guiding principles of banks' Pillar 3 disclosures: 

4.1 Banks should ensure compliance with the following guiding principles which aim to provide a firm foundation for achieving transparent, high-quality Pillar 3 risk disclosures that will enable users to better understand and compare a bank's business and its risks: 

Principle 1: Disclosures should be clear 

4.2 Disclosures should be presented in a form that is understandable to key stakeholders (eg investors, analysts, financial customers and others) and communicated through an accessible medium. Important messages should be highlighted and easy to find. Complex issues should be explained in simple language with important terms defined. Related risk information should be presented together. 

Principle 2: Disclosures should be comprehensive 

4.3 Disclosures should describe a bank's main activities and all significant risks, supported by relevant underlying data and information. Significant changes in risk exposures between reporting periods should be described, together with the appropriate response by management. 

4.4 Disclosures should provide sufficient information in both qualitative and quantitative terms on a bank's processes and procedures for identifying, measuring

and managing those risks. The level of detail of such disclosure should be proportionate to a bank's complexity. 

4.5 Approaches to disclosure should be sufficiently flexible to reflect how senior management and the board of directors internally assess and manage risks and strategy, helping users to better understand a bank's risk tolerance/appetite. 

Principle 3: Disclosures should be meaningful to users 

4.6 Disclosures should highlight a bank's most significant current and emerging risks and how those risks are managed, including information that is likely to receive market attention. Where meaningful, linkages must be provided to line items on the balance sheet or the income statement. Disclosures that do not add value to users' understanding or do not communicate useful information should be avoided. Furthermore, information which is no longer meaningful or relevant to users should be removed. 

Principle 4: Disclosures should be consistent over time 

4.7 Disclosures should be consistent over time to enable key stakeholders to identify trends in a bank's risk profile across all significant aspects of its business. Additions, deletions and other important changes in disclosures from previous reports, including those arising from a bank's specific, regulatory or market developments, should be highlighted and explained. 

Principle 5: Disclosures should be comparable across banks 

4.8 The level of detail and the format of presentation of disclosures should enable key stakeholders to perform meaningful comparisons of business activities, prudential metrics, risks and risk management between banks and across jurisdictions. 

5. Assurance of Pillar 3 data: 

5.1 Banks must establish a formal board-approved disclosure policy for Pillar 3 information that sets out the internal controls and procedures for disclosure of such information. The key elements of this policy should be described in the year-end Pillar 3 report or cross-referenced to another location where they are available. 

5.2 The board of directors and senior management are responsible for establishing and maintaining an effective internal control structure over the disclosure of financial information, including Pillar 3 disclosures. They must also ensure that appropriate review of the disclosures takes place. The information provided by banks under Pillar 3 must be subject, at a minimum, to the same level of internal review and internal control processes as the information provided by banks for their financial

reporting (i.e. the level of assurance must be the same as for information provided within the management discussion and analysis part of the financial report). 

5.3 One or more senior officers of a bank must attest in writing that all Pillar 3 disclosures have been prepared in accordance with the board-agreed internal control processes. 

6. Reporting location: 

6.1 Banks must publish their Pillar 3 report in a standalone document that provides a readily accessible source of prudential measures for users. The Pillar 3 report may be appended to, or form a discrete section of, a bank's financial reporting, but it must be easily identifiable to users. Signposting of disclosure requirements is permitted in certain circumstances, as set out in section 7.2. Banks must also make available on their websites an archive for 10 years retention period of Pillar 3 reports (quarterly, semi-annual and annual) relating to prior reporting periods. 

6.2 Banks are required to submit a copy of the disclosures to SAMA via the following 

email address: BankingDataSection@SAMA.GOV.SA 

7. Presentation of the disclosure requirements: 

7.1 Templates and tables: 

7.1.1 The disclosure requirements are presented either in the form of templates or tables. Templates must be completed with quantitative data in accordance with the definitions provided. Tables generally relate to qualitative requirements, but quantitative information is also required in some instances. Banks may choose the format they prefer when presenting the information requested in tables. 

7.1.2 In line with Principle 3 in section 4.6, the information provided in the templates and tables should be meaningful to users. The disclosure requirements in this document that necessitate an assessment from banks are specifically identified. When preparing these individual tables and templates, banks will need to consider carefully how widely the disclosure requirement should apply. If a bank considers that the information requested in a template or table would not be meaningful to users, for example because the exposures and risk-weighted asset (RWA) amounts are deemed immaterial, it may choose not to disclose part or all of the information requested. In such circumstances, however, the bank will be required to explain in a narrative commentary why it considers such information not to be meaningful to users. It should describe the portfolios

excluded from the disclosure requirement and the aggregate total RWA those portfolios represent. 

7.1.3 For templates, the format is designated as either fixed or flexible: 

a) Where the format of a template is described as fixed, banks must complete the fields in accordance with the instructions given. If a row/column is not considered to be relevant to a bank's activities or the required information would not be meaningful to users (eg immaterial from a quantitative perspective), the bank may delete the specific row/column from the template, but the numbering of the subsequent rows and columns must not be altered. Banks may add extra rows and extra columns to fixed format templates if they wish to provide additional detail to a disclosure requirement by adding sub-rows or columns, but the numbering of prescribed rows and columns in the template must not be altered. 

b) Where the format of a template is described as flexible, banks may present the required information either in the format provided in this document or in one that better suits the bank. The format for the presentation of qualitative information in tables is not prescribed. Notwithstanding, banks should comply with the restrictions in presentation, should such restrictions be prescribed in the template (eg Template CCR5 in section 20). In addition, when a customised presentation of the information is used, the bank must provide information comparable with that required in the disclosure requirement (ie at a similar level of granularity as if the template/table were completed as presented in this document). 

7.2 Signposting: 

7.2.1 Banks may disclose in a document separate from their Pillar 3 report (eg in a bank's annual report or through published regulatory reporting) the templates/tables with a flexible format, and the fixed format templates where the criteria in section 7.2.2 are met. In such circumstances, the bank must signpost clearly in its Pillar 3 report where the disclosure requirements have been published. This signposting in the Pillar 3 report must include: 

a) The title and number of the disclosure requirement; b) The full name of the separate document in which the disclosure requirement 

has been published; 

c) A web link, where relevant; and

d) The page and paragraph number of the separate document where the 

disclosure requirements can be located. 

7.2.2 The disclosure requirements for templates with a fixed format may be disclosed by banks in a separate document other than the Pillar 3 report, provided all of the following criteria are met: 

a) The information contained in the signposted document is equivalent in terms of presentation and content to that required in the fixed template and allows users to make meaningful comparison with information provided by banks disclosing the fixed format templates; 

b) The information contained in the signposted document is based on the same 

scope of consolidation as the one used in the disclosure requirement; 

c) The disclosure in the signposted document is mandatory; and d) SAMA is responsible for ensuring the implementation of the Basel standards is subject to legal constraints in its ability to require the reporting of duplicative information. 

7.2.3 Banks can only make use of signposting to another document if the level of assurance on the reliability of data in the separate document are equivalent to, or greater than, the internal assurance level required for the Pillar 3 report (see sections on reporting location and assurance above). 

8. Frequency and timing of disclosures: 

8.1 The frequencies of disclosure as indicated in the disclosure templates and tables vary between quarterly, semiannual and annual reporting depending upon the nature of the specific disclosure requirement. Annexure 2 summarizes the frequency and timing of disclosures for each table. 

8.2 A bank's Pillar 3 report must be published concurrently with its financial report for the corresponding period. If a Pillar 3 disclosure is required to be published for a period when a bank does not produce any financial report (eg semiannual), disclosures must be published as soon as practicable and the time lag must be no longer than the maximum period of 30 days for quarterly disclosures and 60 days for semiannually and annually disclosures from its regular financial reporting period-ends.

9. Retrospective disclosures, disclosure of transitional metrics and reporting periods: 

9.1 In templates which require the disclosure of data points for current and previous reporting periods, the disclosure of the data point for the previous period is not required when a metric for a new standard is reported for the first time unless this is explicitly stated in the disclosure requirement. 

9.2 Unless otherwise specified in the disclosure templates, when a bank is under a transitional regime permitted by the standards, the transitional data should be reported unless the bank already complies with the fully loaded requirements. Banks should clearly state whether the figures disclosed are computed on a transitional or fully-loaded basis. Where applicable, banks under a transitional regime may separately disclose fully-loaded figures in addition to transitional metrics. 

9.3 Unless otherwise specified in the disclosure templates, the data required for annual, semiannual and quarterly disclosures should be for the corresponding 12-month, six-month and three-month period, respectively. 

10. Proprietary and confidential information: 

10.1 In exceptional cases, where disclosure of certain items required by Pillar 3 may reveal the position of a bank or contravene its legal obligations by making public information that is proprietary or confidential in nature, a bank does not need to disclose those specific items, but must disclose more general information about the subject matter of the requirement instead. It must also explain in the narrative commentary to the disclosure requirement the fact that the specific items of information have not been disclosed and the reasons for this. 

11. Qualitative narrative to accompany the disclosure requirements: 

11.1 Banks should supplement the quantitative information provided in both fixed and flexible templates with a narrative commentary to explain at least any significant changes between reporting periods and any other issues that management considers to be of interest to market participants. The form taken by this additional narrative is at the bank's discretion. 

11.2 Additional voluntary risk disclosures allow banks to present information relevant to their business model that may not be adequately captured by the standardised requirements. Additional quantitative information that banks choose to disclose must provide sufficient meaningful information to enable market participants to understand and analyse any figures provided. It must also be accompanied by a qualitative discussion. Any additional disclosure must comply with the five guiding principles above.

12. Overview of risk management, key prudential metrics and RWA: 

12.1 The disclosure requirements under this section are: 

12.1.1 Template KM1 - Key metrics (at consolidated level) 

12.1.2 Template KM2 - Key metrics - total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) 

requirements (at resolution group level) 

12.1.3 Table OVA - Bank risk management approach 

12.1.4 Template OV1 - Overview of risk-weighted assets (RWA) 

12.2 The disclosure requirements related to TLAC are not required to be completed 

by banks unless otherwise specified by SAMA. 

12.3 Template KM1 provides users of Pillar 3 data with a time series set of key prudential metrics covering a bank's available capital (including buffer requirements and ratios), its RWA, leverage ratio, Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR). As set out in circular No.391000029731 dated 15/03/1439 AH, banks are required to publicly disclose whether they are applying a transitional arrangement for the impact of expected credit loss accounting on regulatory capital. If a transitional arrangement is applied, Template KM1 will provide users with information on the impact on the bank's regulatory capital and leverage ratios compared to the bank's "fully loaded" capital and leverage ratios had the transitional arrangement not been applied. 

12.4 Template KM2 requires global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) to disclose key metrics on TLAC. Template KM2 becomes effective from the TLAC conformance date. 

12.5 Table OVA provides information on a bank's strategy and how senior management 

and the board of directors assess and manage risks. 

12.6 Template OV1 provides an overview of total RWA forming the denominator of the 

risk-based capital requirements.

Template KM1: Key metrics (at consolidated group level) Purpose: To provide an overview of a bank's prudential regulatory metrics. 

Scope of application: The template is mandatory for all banks. Content: Key prudential metrics related to risk-based capital ratios, leverage ratio and liquidity standards. Banks are required to disclose each metric's value using the corresponding standard's specifications for the reporting period-end (designated by T in the template below) as well as the four previous quarter-end figures (T-1 to T-4). All metrics are intended to reflect actual bank values for (T), with the exception of "fully loaded expected credit losses (ECL)" metrics, the leverage ratio (excluding the impact of any applicable temporary exemption of central bank reserves) and metrics designated as "pre-floor" which may not reflect actual values. Frequency: Quarterly. Format: Fixed. If banks wish to add rows to provide additional regulatory or financial metrics, they must provide definitions for these metrics and a full explanation of how the metrics are calculated (including the scope of consolidation and the regulatory capital used if relevant). The additional metrics must not replace the metrics in this disclosure requirement. Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant change in each metric's value compared with previous quarters, including the key drivers of such changes (eg whether the changes are due to changes in the regulatory framework, group structure or business model). Banks that apply transitional arrangement for ECL are expected to supplement the template with the key elements of the transition they use.

Explanation 

For pre-floor total RWA, the disclosed amount should exclude any adjustment made to total RWA from the application of the capital floor. For fully loaded ECL ratios (%) in rows 5a, 6a, 7a and 14a, the denominator (RWA, Basel III leverage ratio exposure measure) is also "Fully loaded ECL", ie as if ECL transitional arrangements were not applied. 

For pre-floor risk based ratios in rows 5b, 6b and 7b, the disclosed ratios should exclude the impact of the capital floor in the calculation of RWA. 

CET1 available after meeting the bank's minimum capital requirements (as a percentage of RWA): it may not necessarily be the difference between row 5 and the Basel III minimum CET1 requirement of 4.5% because CET1 capital may be used to meet the bank's Tier 1 and/or total capital ratio requirements. See instructions to [CC1:68/a]. Total Basel III leverage ratio exposure measure: The amounts may reflect period-end values or averages depending on local implementation. Total HQLA: total adjusted value using simple averages of daily observations over the previous quarter (ie the average calculated over a period of, typically, 90 days). Total net cash outflow: total adjusted value using simple averages of daily observations over the previous quarter (ie the average calculated over a period of, typically, 90 days).

(a) 

(b) 

(c) 

How the business model determines and interacts with the overall risk profile (eg the key risks related to the business model and how each of these risks is reflected and described in the risk disclosures) and how the risk profile of the bank interacts with the risk tolerance approved by the board. The risk governance structure: responsibilities attributed throughout the bank (eg oversight and delegation of authority; breakdown of responsibilities by type of risk, business unit etc); relationships between the structures involved in risk management processes (eg board of directors, executive management, separate risk committee, risk management structure, compliance function, internal audit function). Channels to communicate, decline and enforce the risk culture within the bank (eg code of conduct; manuals containing operating limits or procedures to treat violations or breaches of risk thresholds; procedures to raise and share risk issues between business lines and risk functions). 

(d) The scope and main features of risk measurement systems. 

(e) 

(f) 

(g) 

Description of the process of risk information reporting provided to the board and senior management, in particular the scope and main content of reporting on risk exposure. Qualitative information on stress testing (eg portfolios subject to stress testing, scenarios adopted and methodologies used, and use of stress testing in risk management). The strategies and processes to manage, hedge and mitigate risks that arise from the bank's business model and the processes for monitoring the continuing effectiveness of hedges and mitigants.

Template OV1: Overview of RWA Purpose: To provide an overview of total RWA forming the denominator of the risk-based capital requirements. Further breakdowns of RWA are presented in subsequent parts. Scope of application: The template is mandatory for all banks. 

Content: RWA and capital requirements under Pillar 1. Pillar 2 requirements should not be included. Frequency: Quarterly. 

Format: Fixed. Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to identify and explain the drivers behind differences in reporting periods T and T-1 where these differences are significant. When minimum capital requirements in column (c) do not correspond to 8% of RWA in column (a), banks must explain the adjustments made. If the bank uses the internal model method (IMM) for its equity exposures under the market-based approach, it must provide annually a description of the main characteristics of its internal model.

Credit risk (excluding counterparty credit risk): RWA and capital requirements according to the credit risk standard of the Basel framework (SCRE), with the exceptions of RWA and capital requirements related to: (i) counterparty credit risk (reported in row 6); (ii) equity positions (reported in row 11 to 14); (iii) settlement risk (reported in row 15); (iv) securitisation positions subject to the securitisation regulatory framework, including securitisation exposures in the banking book (reported in row 16); and (v) amounts below the thresholds for deduction (reported in row 25). Of which: standardised approach: RWA and capital requirements according to the standardised approach to credit risk (as specified in SCRE5 to SCRE9). Of which: (foundation/advanced) internal rating based approaches: RWA and capital requirements according to the F-IRB approach and/or A-IRB approach (as specified in SCRE10 to SCRE16 with the exception of SCRE13). Of which: supervisory slotting approach: RWA and capital requirements according to the supervisory slotting approach (as specified in SCRE13). Counterparty credit risk: RWA and capital charges according to the counterparty credit risk chapters of the Basel framework (SCCR3 to SCCR10). Credit valuation adjustment: RWA and capital charge requirements according to SCCR11. Equity positions under the simple risk weight approach and internal models method: the amounts in row 11 correspond to RWA where the bank applies the simple risk weight approach or the internal model method, which remain available during the five-year linear phase-in arrangement as specified in SCRE17.2. Equity positions under the PD/LGD approach during the five-year linear phase-in arrangement should be reported in row 3. Where the regulatory treatment of equities is in accordance with the standardised approach, the corresponding RWA are reported in Template CR4 and included in row 2 of this template. Equity investments in funds - look-through approach: RWA and capital requirements calculated in accordance with SCRE24. Equity investments in funds - mandate-based approach: RWA and capital requirements calculated in accordance with SCRE24. Equity investments in funds - fall-back approach: RWA and capital requirements calculated in accordance with SCRE24. Settlement risk: the amounts correspond to the requirements in SCRE25. Securitisation exposures in banking book: the amounts correspond to capital requirements applicable to the securitisation exposures in the banking book. The RWA amounts must be derived from the capital requirements (which include the impact of the cap in accordance with SCRE18.50 to SCRE18.55, and do not systematically correspond to the RWA reported in Templates SEC3 and SEC4, which are before application of the cap). Market risk: the amounts reported in row 20 correspond to the RWA and capital requirements in the market risk standard (MAR), with the exception of amounts that relate to CVA risk (as specified in SCCR11 and reported in row 10). They also include capital charges for securitisation positions booked in the trading book but exclude the counterparty credit risk capital charges (reported in row 6 of this template). The RWA for market risk correspond to the capital charge times 12.5. Of which: standardised approach: RWA and capital requirements according to the market risk standardised approach, including capital requirements for securitisation positions booked in the trading book. 

Of which: Internal Models Approach: RWA and capital requirements according to the market risk IMA. 

Capital charge for switch between trading book and banking book: outstanding accumulated capital surcharge imposed on the bank in accordance with Basel Framework "Risk-based capital requirements" (Boundary between the banking book and trading book) 25.14 and 25.15, when the total capital charge (across banking book and trading book) of a bank is reduced as a result of the instruments being switched between the trading book and the banking book at the bank's discretion and after their original designation. The outstanding accumulated capital surcharge takes into account any adjustment due to run-off as the positions mature or expire, in a manner agreed with SAMA. 

Operational risk: the amounts corresponding to the minimum capital requirements for operational risk as specified in the operational risk standard (SOPE). 

Amounts below the thresholds for deduction (subject to 250% risk weight): the amounts correspond to items subject to a 250% risk weight according to SACAP4.4. They include significant investments in the capital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory consolidation and below the threshold for deduction, after application of the 250% risk weight. 

Output floor applied: the output floor (expressed as a percentage) applied by the bank in its computation of the floor adjustment value in rows 27 and 28. 

Floor adjustment (before the application of transitional cap): the impact of the output floor before the application of the transitional cap, based on the output floor applied in row 26, in terms of the increase in RWA. 

Floor adjustment (after the application of transitional cap): the impact of the output floor after the application of the transitional cap, based on the output floor applied in row 26, in terms of the increase in RWA. The figure disclosed in this row takes into account the transitional cap (if any) applied by SAMA, which will limit the increase in RWA to 25% of the bank's RWA before the application of the output floor.

13. Comparison of modelled and standardised RWA: 

13.1 This chapter covers disclosures on RWA calculated according to the full standardised approach as compared to the actual RWA at the risk level, and for credit risk at asset class and sub-asset class levels. The disclosure requirements related in this section are not required to be completed by banks unless SAMA approve the bank to use the IRB and/or IMA approach. 

13.2 The disclosure requirements under this section are: 

13.2.1Template CMS1 - Comparison of modelled and standardised RWA at risk 

level 

13.2.2Template CMS2 - Comparison of modelled and standardised RWA for 

credit risk at asset class level 

13.3 Template CMS1 provides the disclosure of RWA calculated according to the full standardised approach as compared to actual RWA at risk level. Template CMS2 further elaborates on the comparison between RWA computed under the standardised and the internally modelled approaches by focusing on RWA for credit risk at asset class and sub-asset class levels.

Template CMS1 - Comparison of modelled and standardised RWA at risk level Purpose: To compare full standardised risk-weighted assets (RWA) against modelled RWA for banks which have received SAMA's approval to use internal models in accordance with the Basel framework. The disclosure also provides the full standardised RWA amount that is the base of the output floor as defined in Basel Framework "Risk-based capital requirements" (calculation of minimum risk-based capital requirements) as specified in the Output floor to be issued by SAMA. Scope of application: The template is mandatory for all banks using internal models. 

Content: RWA. 

Frequency: Quarterly. Format: Fixed. 

Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to explain the main drivers of difference (eg asset class or sub-asset class of a particular risk category, key assumptions underlying parameter estimations, national implementation differences) between the internally modelled RWA disclosed that are used to calculate their capital ratios and RWA disclosed under the full standardised approach that would be used should the banks not be allowed to use internal models. Explanation should be specific and, where appropriate, might be supplemented with quantitative information. In particular, if the RWA for securitisation exposures in the banking book are a main driver of the difference, banks are expected to explain the extent to which they are using each of the three potential approaches (SEC-ERBA, SEC-SA and 1,250% risk weight) for calculating SA RWA for securitisation exposures.

Definitions and instructions Rows: 

Credit risk (excluding counterparty credit risk, credit valuation adjustments and securitisation exposures in the banking book) (row 1): 

Definition of standardised approach: The standardised approach for credit risk. When calculating the degree of credit risk mitigation, banks must use the simple approach or the comprehensive approach with standard supervisory haircuts. This also includes failed trades and non-delivery-versus-payment transactions as set out in SCRE25. 

The prohibition on the use of the IRB approach for equity exposures will be subject to a five-year linear phase-in arrangement as specified in SCRE17.2. During the phase-in period, the risk weight for equity exposures used to calculate the RWA reported in column (a) will be the greater of: (i) the risk weight as calculated under the IRB approach, and (ii) the risk weight set for the linear phase-in arrangement under the standardised approach for credit risk 

RWA for modelled approaches that banks have SAMA approval to use (cell 1/a): For exposures where the RWA is not computed based on the standardised approach described above (ie subject to the credit risk IRB approaches (Foundation Internal Ratings-Based (F-IRB), Advanced Internal Ratings-Based (A-IRB) and supervisory slotting approaches of the credit risk framework). The row excludes all positions subject to SCRE18 to SCRE23, including securitisation exposures in the banking book (which are reported in row 4) and capital requirements relating to a counterparty credit risk charge, which are reported in row 2.

RWA calculated using full standardised approach (cell 1/d): RWA as would result from applying the above-described standardised approach to all exposures giving rise to the RWA reported in cell 1/c. 

Counterparty credit risk (row 2): 

Definition of standardised approach: To calculate the exposure for derivatives, banks must use the standardised approach for measuring counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR). The exposure amounts must then be multiplied by the relevant borrower risk weight using the standardised approach for credit risk to calculate RWA under the standardised approach for credit risk. 

RWA for modelled approaches that banks have SAMA approval to use (cell 2/a): For exposures where the RWA is not computed based on the standardised approach described above.

RWA calculated using full standardised approach (cell 2/d): RWA as would result from applying the above-described standardised approach to all exposures giving rise to the RWA reported in cell 2/c. 

Credit valuation adjustment (row 3): 

Definition of standardised approach: The standardised approach for CVA (SA-CVA), the basic approach (BA-CVA) or 100% of a bank's counterparty credit risk capital requirements (depending on which approach the bank uses for CVA risk). 

Total actual RWA (cell 3/c) and RWA calculated using full standardised approach (cell 3/d): RWA according to the standardised approach described above.

Market risk (row 5): 

Definition of standardised approach: The standardised approach for market risk. The SEC-ERBA, SEC-SA or a risk weight of 1,250% must also be used when determining the default risk charge component for securitisations held in the trading book. 

RWA for modelled approaches that banks have SAMA approval to use (cell 5/a): For exposures where the RWA is not computed based on the standardised approach described above. 

RWA for portfolios where standardised approaches are used (cell 5/b): RWA which result from applying the above-described standardised approach.

Operational risk (row 6): 

Definition of standardised approach: The standardised approach for operational risk. 

Total actual RWA (cell 6/c) and RWA calculated using full standardised approach (cell 6/d): RWA according to the revised standardised approach for operational risk. 

Residual RWA (row 7): 

Total actual RWA (cell 7/c) and RWA calculated using full standardised approach (cell 7/d): RWA not captured within rows 1 to 6 (ie the RWA arising from equity investments in funds (rows 12 to 14 in Template OV1), settlement risk (row 15 in Template OV1), capital charge for switch between trading book and banking book (row 23 in Template OV1) and amounts below the thresholds for deduction (row 25 in Template OV1)). 

Total (row 8): 

RWA for modelled approaches that banks have SAMA approval to use (cell 8/a): The total sum of cells 1/a, 2/a, 4/a and 5/a. 

RWA for portfolios where standardised approaches are used (cell 8/b): The total sum of cells 1/b, 2/b, 3/b, 4/b, 5/b, 6/b and 7/b. 

Total actual RWA (cell 8/c): The bank's total RWA before the output floor adjustment. The total sum of cells 1/c, 2/c, 3/c, 4/c, 5/c, 6/c and 7/c. 

RWA calculated using full standardised approach (cell 8/d): The bank's RWA that are the base of the output floor, as specified in the Output floor to be issued by SAMA (ie amount before multiplication by 72.5%). The total sum of cells 1/d, 2/d, 3/d, 4/d, 5/d, 6/d and 7/d.

Template CMS2 - Comparison of modelled and standardised RWA for credit risk at asset class level Purpose: To compare risk-weighted assets (RWA) calculated according to the standardised approach (SA) for credit risk at the asset class level against the corresponding RWA figure calculated using the approaches (including both the standardised and IRB approach for credit risk and the supervisory slotting approach) that banks have SAMA approval to use in accordance with the Basel framework for credit risk. Scope of application: The template is mandatory for all banks using internal models for credit risk. Similar to row 1 of Template CMS1, it excludes counterparty credit risk, credit valuation adjustments and securitisation exposures in the banking book. Content: RWA. Frequency: Semiannual. Format: Fixed. The columns are fixed, but the portfolio breakdowns in the rows will be set by SAMA to reflect the exposure classes required under national implementation of IRB and SA. Banks are encouraged to add rows to show where significant differences occur. Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to explain the main drivers of differences between the internally modelled amounts disclosed that are used to calculate their capital ratios and amounts disclosed should the banks apply the standardised approach. Where differences are attributable to mapping between IRB and SA, banks are encouraged to provide explanation and estimated materiality.

1 The prohibition on the use of the IRB approach for equity exposures will be subject to a five-year linear phase-in arrangement as specified in SCRE17.2. During the phase-in period, the risk weight for equity exposures (to be reported in column (a)) will be the greater of: (i) the risk weight as calculated under the IRB approach, and (ii) the risk weight set for the linear phase-in arrangement under the standardised approach for credit risk. Column (b) should reflect the corresponding RWA for these exposures based on the phased-in standardised approach. After the phase-in period, columns (a) and (b) for equity exposures should both be empty.

14. Composition of capital and TLAC: 

14.1 The disclosures described in this chapter cover the composition of regulatory capital, the main features of regulatory capital instruments and, for global systemically important banks, the composition of total loss-absorbing capacity and the creditor hierarchies of material subgroups and resolution entities. The disclosure requirements related to TLAC only, are not required to be completed by banks unless otherwise specified by SAMA. 

14.2 The disclosure requirements set out in this chapter are: 

14.2.1 Table CCA - Main features of regulatory capital instruments and of other 

total loss-absorbing capacity (TLAC) - eligible instruments 

14.2.2 Template CC1 - Composition of regulatory capital 

14.2.3 Template CC2 - Reconciliation of regulatory capital to balance sheet 

14.2.4 Template TLAC1 - TLAC composition for global systemically important 

banks (G-SIBs) (at resolution group level) 

14.2.5 Template TLAC2 - Material subgroup entity - creditor ranking at legal 

entity level 

14.2.6 Template TLAC3 - Resolution entity - creditor ranking at legal entity level 

14.3 The following table and templates must be completed by all banks: 

14.3.1 Table CCA details the main features of a bank's regulatory capital instruments and other TLAC-eligible instruments, where applicable. This 

table should be posted on a bank's website, with the web link referenced in 

the bank's Pillar 3 report to facilitate users' access to the required disclosure. Table CCA represents the minimum level of disclosure that banks are required to report in respect of each regulatory capital instrument and, where applicable, other TLAC-eligible instruments issued.2 

2 In this context, "other TLAC-eligible instruments" are instruments other than regulatory capital instruments issued by G-SIBs that meet the TLAC eligibility criteria.

14.3.2 Template CC1 details the composition of a bank's regulatory capital. 

14.3.3 Template CC2 provides users of Pillar 3 data with a reconciliation between 

the scope of a bank's accounting consolidation, as per published financial statements, and the scope of its regulatory consolidation. 

14.4 The following additional templates must be completed by banks which have been 

designated as G-SIBs: 

14.4.1 Template TLAC1 provides details of the TLAC positions of G-SIB resolution groups. This disclosure requirement applies to all G-SIBs at the resolution group level. For single point of entry G-SIBs, there is only one resolution group. This means that they only need to complete Template TLAC1 once to report their TLAC positions. 

14.4.2 Templates TLAC2 and TLAC3 present information on creditor rankings at the legal entity level for material subgroup entities (ie entities that are part of a material subgroup) which have issued internal TLAC to one or more resolution entities, and also for resolution entities. These templates provide information on the amount and residual maturity of TLAC and on the instruments issued by resolution entities and material subgroup entities that rank pari passu with, or junior to, TLAC instruments. 

14.5 Templates TLAC1, TLAC2 and TLAC3 become effective from the TLAC 

conformance date. 

14.6 Through the following three-step approach, all banks are required to show the link between the balance sheet in their published financial statements and the numbers disclosed in Template CC1: 

14.6.1 Step 1: Disclose the reported balance sheet under the regulatory scope of consolidation in Template CC2. If the scopes of regulatory consolidation and accounting consolidation are identical for a particular banking group, banks should state in Template CC2 that there is no difference and move on to Step 2. Where the accounting and regulatory scopes of consolidation differ, banks are required to disclose the list of those legal entities that are included within the accounting scope of consolidation, but excluded from the regulatory scope of consolidation or, alternatively, any legal entities included in the regulatory consolidation that are not included in the accounting scope of consolidation. This will enable users of Pillar 3 data to consider any risks posed by unconsolidated subsidiaries. If some entities are included in both the regulatory and accounting scopes of consolidation, but the method of consolidation differs between these two scopes, banks are required to list the relevant legal entities separately and explain the

differences in the consolidation methods. For each legal entity that is required to be disclosed in this requirement, a bank must also disclose the 

total assets and equity on the entity's balance sheet and a description of the 

entity's principal activities. 

14.6.2 Step 2: Expand the lines of the balance sheet under the regulatory scope of consolidation in Template CC2 to display all of the components that are used in Template CC1. It should be noted that banks will only need to expand elements of the balance sheet to the extent necessary to determine the components that are used in Template CC1 (eg if all of the paid-in capital of the bank meets the requirements to be included in Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital, the bank would not need to expand this line). The level of 

disclosure should be proportionate to the complexity of the bank's balance sheet and its capital structure. 

14.6.3 Step 3: Map each of the components that are disclosed in Template CC2 in 

Step 2 to the composition of capital disclosure set out in Template CC1.

Table CCA - Main features of regulatory capital instruments and of other TLAC-eligible instruments Purpose: Provide a description of the main features of a bank's regulatory capital instruments and other TLAC-eligible instruments, as applicable, that are recognised as part of its capital base / TLAC resources. Scope of application: The template is mandatory for all banks. In addition to completing the template for all regulatory capital instruments, G-SIB resolution entities should complete the template (including lines 3a and 34a) for all other TLAC-eligible instruments that are recognised as external TLAC resources by the resolution entities, starting from the TLAC conformance date. Internal TLAC instruments and other senior debt instruments are not covered in this template. Content: Quantitative and qualitative information as required. Frequency: Table CCA should be posted on a bank's website. It should be updated whenever the bank issues or repays a capital instrument (or other TLAC-eligible instrument where applicable), and whenever there is a redemption, conversion/writedown or other material change in the nature of an existing instrument. Updates should, at a minimum, be made semiannually. Banks should include the web link in each Pillar 3 report to the issuances made over the previous period. Format: Flexible. Accompanying information: Banks are required to make available on their websites the full terms and conditions of all instruments included in regulatory capital and TLAC.

Instructions Banks are required to complete the template for each outstanding regulatory capital instrument and, in the case of G-SIBs, TLAC-eligible instruments (banks should insert "NA" if the question is not applicable). Banks are required to report each instrument, including common shares, in a separate column of the template, such that the completed Table CCA would provide a "main features report" that summarises all of the regulatory capital and TLAC-eligible instruments of the banking group. G-SIBs disclosing these instruments should group them under three sections (horizontally along the table) to indicate whether they are for meeting (i) only capital (but not TLAC) requirements; (ii) both capital and TLAC requirements; or (iii) only TLAC (but not capital) requirements.

Explanation 

Identifies issuer legal entity. Unique identifier (eg CUSIP, ISIN or Bloomberg identifier for private placement). Specifies the governing law(s) of the instrument. Other TLAC-eligible instruments governed by foreign law (ie a law other than that of the home jurisdiction of a resolution entity) include a clause in the contractual provisions whereby investors expressly submit to, and provide consent to the application of, the use of resolution tools in relation to the instrument by the home authority notwithstanding any provision of foreign law to the contrary, unless there is equivalent binding statutory provision for cross-border recognition of resolution actions. Select "NA" where the governing law of the instrument is the same as that of the country of incorporation of the resolution entity. Specifies the regulatory capital treatment during the Basel III transitional phase (ie the component of capital from which the instrument is being phased out). Specifies regulatory capital treatment under Basel III rules not taking into account transitional treatment. Specifies the level(s) within the group at which the instrument is included in capital. 

Specifies instrument type, varying by jurisdiction. Helps provide more granular understanding of features, particularly during transition. Specifies amount recognised in regulatory capital. Par value of instrument. Specifies accounting classification. Helps to assess loss-absorbency. 

Specifies date of issuance. Specifies whether dated or perpetual. For dated instrument, specifies original maturity date (day, month and year). For perpetual instrument, enter "no maturity". Specifies whether there is an issuer call option. For instrument with issuer call option, specifies: (i) the first date of call if the instrument has a call option on a specific date (day, month and year); (ii) the instrument has a tax and/or regulatory event call; and (iii) the redemption price. Specifies the existence and frequency of subsequent call dates, if applicable. Specifies whether the coupon/dividend is fixed over the life of the instrument, floating over the life of the instrument, currently fixed but will move to a floating rate in the future, or currently floating but will move to a fixed rate in the future. Specifies the coupon rate of the instrument and any related index that the coupon/dividend rate references.

Specifies whether the non-payment of a coupon or dividend on the instrument prohibits the payment of dividends on common shares (ie whether there is a dividend-stopper). Specifies whether the issuer has full, partial or no discretion over whether a coupon/dividend is paid. If the bank has full discretion to cancel coupon/dividend payments under all circumstances, it must select "fully discretionary" (including when there is a dividend-stopper that does not have the effect of preventing the bank from cancelling payments on the instrument). If there are conditions that must be met before payment can be cancelled (eg capital below a certain threshold), the bank must select "partially discretionary". If the bank is unable to cancel the payment outside of insolvency, the bank must select "mandatory". Specifies whether there is a step-up or other incentive to redeem. Specifies whether dividends/coupons are cumulative or non-cumulative. 

Specifies whether the instrument is convertible. 

Specifies the conditions under which the instrument will convert, including point of non-viability. Where one or more authorities have the ability to trigger conversion, the authorities should be listed. For each of the authorities it should be stated whether the legal basis for the authority to trigger conversion is provided by the terms of the contract of the instrument (a contractual approach) or statutory means (a statutory approach). For conversion trigger separately, specifies whether the instrument will: (i) always convert fully; (ii) may convert fully or partially; or (iii) will always convert partially. Specifies the rate of conversion into the more loss-absorbent instrument. For convertible instruments, specifies whether conversion is mandatory or optional. For convertible instruments, specifies the instrument type it is convertible into. 

If convertible, specifies the issuer of the instrument into which it converts. Specifies whether there is a writedown feature. Specifies the trigger at which writedown occurs, including point of non-viability. Where one or more authorities have the ability to trigger writedown, the authorities should be listed. For each of the authorities it should be stated whether the legal basis for the authority to trigger conversion is provided by the terms of the contract of the instrument (a contractual approach) or statutory means (a statutory approach). For each writedown trigger separately, specifies whether the instrument will: (i) always be written down fully; (ii) may be written down partially; or (iii) will always be written down partially. For writedown instruments, specifies whether writedown is permanent or temporary. 

For instruments that have a temporary writedown, description of writeup mechanism. Type of subordination. 

Specifies instrument to which it is most immediately subordinate. Where applicable, banks should specify the column numbers of the instruments in the completed main features template to which the instrument is most immediately subordinate. In the case of structural subordination, "NA" should be entered. Specifies whether there are non-compliant features. If there are non-compliant features, specifies which ones.

Instructions (i) Rows in italics will be deleted after all the ineligible capital instruments have been fully phased out (ie from 1 January 2022 onwards). (ii) The reconciliation requirements included in Template CC2 result in the decomposition of certain regulatory adjustments. For example, the disclosure template below includes the adjustment "Goodwill net of related tax liability". The reconciliation requirements will lead to the disclosure of both the goodwill component and the related tax liability component of this regulatory adjustment. 

(iii) Shading: 

- Each dark grey row introduces a new section detailing a certain component of regulatory capital. - Light grey rows with no thick border represent the sum cells in the relevant section. - Light grey rows with a thick border show the main components of regulatory capital and the capital adequacy ratios. 

Columns Source: Banks are required to complete column b to show the source of every major input, which is to be cross-referenced to the corresponding rows in Template CC2. Rows Set out in the following table is an explanation of each row of the template above. Regarding the regulatory adjustments, banks are required to report deductions from capital as positive numbers and additions to capital as negative numbers. For example, goodwill (row 8) should be reported as a positive number, as should gains due to the change in the own credit risk of the bank (row 14). However, losses due to the change in the own credit risk of the bank should be reported as a negative number as these are added back in the calculation of CET1 capital. Row number 

Explanation 

Instruments issued by the parent company of the reporting group that meet all of the CET1 capital entry criteria set out in SACAP2.2.1. This should be equal to the sum of common stock (and related surplus only) and other instruments for non-joint stock companies, both of which must meet the common stock criteria. This should be net of treasury stock and other investments in own shares to the extent that these are already derecognised on the balance sheet under the relevant accounting standards. Other paid-in capital elements must be excluded. All minority interest must be excluded. Retained earnings, prior to all regulatory adjustments. In accordance with SACAP2.2.1, this row should include interim profit and loss that has met any audit, verification or review procedures that SAMA has put in place. Dividends are to be removed in accordance with the applicable accounting standards, ie they should be removed from this row when they are removed from the balance sheet of the bank. Accumulated other comprehensive income and other disclosed reserves, prior to all regulatory adjustments. Directly issued capital instruments subject to phase-out from CET1 capital in accordance with the requirements of SACAP5.7. This is only applicable to non-joint stock companies. Banks structured as joint stock companies must report zero in this row. Common share capital issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties. Only the amount that is eligible for inclusion in group CET1 capital should be reported here, as determined by the application of SACAP3.1 (see SACAP Annex #7 for an example of the calculation). Sum of rows 1 to 5.

For non-G-SIBs, any amount reported in this row will reflect other TLAC liabilities not covered by the 5% threshold and that cannot be absorbed by the 10% threshold. For G-SIBs, the 5% threshold is subject to additional conditions; deductions in excess of the 5% threshold are reported instead in 54a. (This row is for G-SIBs only.) Investments in other TLAC liabilities of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory consolidation and where the bank does not own more than 10% of the issued common share capital of the entity, previously designated for the 5% threshold but no longer meeting the conditions under paragraph 80a of the TLAC holdings standard, measured on a gross long basis. The amount to be deducted will be the amount of other TLAC liabilities designated to the 5% threshold but not sold within 30 business days, no longer held in the trading book or now exceeding the 5% threshold (eg in the instance of decreasing CET1 capital). Note that, for G-SIBs, amounts designated to this threshold may not subsequently be moved to the 10% threshold.

The amount in row 64 (expressed as a percentage of risk-weighted assets) that relates to the bank's higher loss absorbency requirement, if applicable. CET1 capital (as a percentage of risk-weighted assets) available after meeting the bank's minimum capital requirements. To be calculated as the CET1 capital adequacy ratio of the bank (row 61) less the ratio of RWA of any common equity used to meet the bank's minimum CET1, Tier 1 and Total capital requirements. For example, suppose a bank has 100 RWA, 10 CET1 capital, 1.5 additional Tier 1 capital and no Tier 2 capital. Since it does not have any Tier 2 capital, it will have to earmark its CET1 capital to meet the 8% minimum capital requirement. The net CET1 capital left to meet other requirements (which could include Pillar 2, buffers or TLAC requirements) will be 10 - 4.5 - 2 = 3.5. National minimum CET1 capital adequacy ratio (if different from Basel III minimum). Refer to SACAP for guidance. National minimum Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio (if different from Basel III minimum). Refer to SACAP for guidance. National minimum Total capital adequacy ratio (if different from Basel III minimum). Refer to SACAP for guidance.

Template CC2 - Reconciliation of regulatory capital to balance sheet 

Purpose: Enable users to identify the differences between the scope of accounting consolidation and the scope of regulatory consolidation, and to show the link between a bank's balance sheet in its published financial statements and the numbers that are used in the composition of capital disclosure template set out in Template CC1. Scope of application: The template is mandatory for all banks. Content: Carrying values (corresponding to the values reported in financial statements). Frequency: Semiannual. Format: Flexible (but the rows must align with the presentation of the bank's financial report). Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant changes in the expanded balance sheet items over the reporting period and the key drivers of such change. Narrative commentary to significant changes in other balance sheet items could be found in Table LIA.

Banks are required to take their balance sheet in their published financial statements (numbers reported in column a above) and report the numbers when the regulatory scope of consolidation is applied (numbers reported in column b above).. If there are rows in the balance sheet under the regulatory scope of consolidation that are not present in the published financial statements, banks are required to add these and give a value of zero in column a. If a bank's scope of accounting consolidation and its scope of regulatory consolidation are exactly the same, columns a and b should be merged and this fact should be clearly disclosed. 

Rows 

Similar to Template LI1, the rows in the above template should follow the balance sheet presentation used by the bank in its financial statements, on which basis the bank is required to expand the balance sheet to identify all the items that are disclosed in Template CC1. Set out above (ie items a to i) are some examples of items that may need to be expanded for a particular banking group. Disclosure should be proportionate to the complexity of the bank's balance sheet. Each item must be given a reference number/letter in column c that is used as cross-reference to column b of Template CC1. 

Linkages across templates 

(i) The amounts in columns a and b in Template CC2 before balance sheet expansion (ie before Step 2) should be identical to columns a and b in 

Template LI1. 

(ii) Each expanded item is to be cross-referenced to the corresponding items in Template CC1.

Instructions For SPE G-SIBs, where the resolution group is the same as the regulatory scope of consolidation for Basel III regulatory capital, those rows that refer to regulatory capital before adjustments coincide with information provided under Template CC1. For MPE G-SIBs, information is provided for each resolution group. Aggregation of capital and total RWA for capital purposes across resolution groups will not necessarily equal or directly correspond to values reported for regulatory capital and RWA under Template CC1. The TLAC position related to the regulatory capital of the resolution group shall include only capital instruments issued by entities belonging to the resolution group. Similarly, the TLAC position is based on the RWA (adjusted as permitted under Section 3 of the TLAC Term Sheet) and leverage ratio exposure measures calculated at the level of the resolution group. Regarding the shading: - Each dark grey row introduces a new section detailing a certain component of TLAC. - The light grey rows with no thick border represent the sum cells in the relevant section. - The light grey rows with a thick border show the main components of TLAC. 

The following table explains each row of the above template. Regarding the regulatory adjustments, banks are required to report deductions from capital or TLAC as positive numbers and additions to capital or TLAC as negative numbers. For example, the amortised portion of Tier 2 where remaining maturity is greater than one year (row 7) should be reported as a negative number (as it adds back in the calculation of Tier 2 instruments eligible as TLAC), while Tier 2 capital ineligible as TLAC (row 8) should be reported as a positive number.

CET1 capital of the resolution group, calculated in line with the Basel III and TLAC frameworks. 

AT 1 capital. This row will provide information on the AT1 capital of the resolution group, calculated in line with the SACAP standard and the TLAC framework. 

AT1 instruments issued out of subsidiaries to third parties that are ineligible as TLAC. According to Section 8c of the TLAC Term Sheet, such instruments could be recognised to meet minimum TLAC until 31 December 2021. An amount (equal to that reported in row 34 in Template CC1) should thus be reported only starting from 1 January 2022. 

Other elements of AT1 capital that are ineligible as TLAC (excluding those already incorporated in row 3). 

AT1 instruments eligible under the TLAC framework, to be calculated as row 2 minus rows 3 and 4. 

Tier 2 capital of the resolution group, calculated in line with the Basel III and TLAC frameworks. 

Amortised portion of Tier 2 instruments where remaining maturity is greater than one year. This row recognises that as long as the remaining maturity of a Tier 2 instrument is above the one-year residual maturity requirement of the TLAC Term Sheet, the full amount may be included in TLAC, even if the instrument is partially derecognised in regulatory capital via the requirement to amortise the instrument in the five years before maturity. Only the amount not recognised in regulatory capital but meeting all TLAC eligibility criteria should be reported in this row. Tier 2 instruments issued out of subsidiaries to third parties that are ineligible as TLAC. According to Section 8c of the TLAC Term Sheet, such instruments could be recognised to meet minimum TLAC until 31 December 2021. An amount (equal to that reported in row 48 of Template CC1) should thus be reported only starting from 1 January 2022.

External TLAC instruments issued directly by the resolution entity that are not subordinated to Excluded Liabilities but meet the other TLAC Term Sheet requirements. The amount reported in this row should be those subject to recognition as a result of the application of the penultimate and antepenultimate paragraphs of Section 11 of the TLAC Term Sheet. The full amounts should be reported in this row, ie without applying the 2.5% and 3.5% caps set out the penultimate paragraph.

External TLAC instrument issued by a funding vehicle prior to 1 January 2022. Amounts issued after 1 January 2022 are not eligible as TLAC and should not be reported here. Eligible ex ante commitments to recapitalise a G-SIB in resolution, subject to the conditions set out in the second paragraph of Section 7 of the TLAC Term Sheet. Non-regulatory capital elements of TLAC before adjustments. To be calculated as: row 12 + row 14 + row 15 + row 16. TLAC before adjustments. To be calculated as: row 11 + row 17. Deductions of exposures between MPE G-SIB resolution groups that correspond to items eligible for TLAC (not applicable for SPE G-SIBs). All amounts reported in this row should correspond to deductions applied after the appropriate adjustments agreed by the crisis management group (CMG) (following the penultimate paragraph of Section 3 of the TLAC Term Sheet, the CMG shall discuss and, where appropriate and consistent with the resolution strategy, agree on the allocation of the deduction). Deductions of investments in own other TLAC liabilities; amount to be deducted from TLAC resources in accordance with SACAP4.1.6. Other adjustments to TLAC. TLAC of the resolution group (as the case may be) after deductions. To be calculated as: row 18 - row 19 - row 20 - row 21. Total RWA of the resolution group under the TLAC regime. For SPE G-SIBs, this information is based on the consolidated figure, so the amount reported in this row will coincide with that in row 60 of Template CC1. Leverage exposure measure of the resolution group (denominator of leverage ratio). TLAC ratio (as a percentage of RWA for TLAC purposes), to be calculated as row 22 divided by row 23. TLAC ratio (as a percentage of leverage exposure measure), to be calculated as row 22 divided by row 24. CET1 capital (as a percentage of RWA) available after meeting the resolution group's minimum capital requirements and TLAC requirement. To be calculated as the CET1 capital adequacy ratio, less any common equity (as a percentage of RWA) used to meet CET1, Tier 1, and Total minimum capital and TLAC requirements. For example, suppose a resolution group (that is subject to regulatory capital requirements) has 100 RWA, 10 CET1 capital, 1.5 AT1 capital, no Tier 2 capital and 9 non-regulatory capital TLAC-eligible instruments. The resolution group will have to earmark its CET1 capital to meet the 8% minimum capital requirement and 18% minimum TLAC requirement. The net CET1 capital left to meet other requirements (which could include Pillar 2 or buffers) will be 10 - 4.5 - 2 - 1 = 2.5. Bank-specific buffer requirement (capital conservation buffer plus countercyclical buffer requirements plus G-SIB buffer requirement, expressed as a percentage of RWA). Calculated as the sum of: (i) the G-SIB's capital conservation buffer; (ii) the G-SIB's specific countercyclical buffer requirement calculated in accordance with SACAP; and (iii) the higher loss-absorbency requirement as set out in SACAP. Not applicable to individual resolution groups of an MPE G-SIB, unless the relevant authority imposes buffer requirements at the level of consolidation and requires such disclosure. The amount in row 28 (expressed as a percentage of RWA) that relates to the capital conservation buffer), ie G-SIBs will report 2.5% here. Not applicable to individual resolution groups of an MPE G-SIB, unless otherwise required by the relevant authority. The amount in row 28 (expressed as a percentage of RWA) that relates to the G-SIB's specific countercyclical buffer requirement.

-This template is the same as Template TLAC 2 except that no information is collected regarding exposures to the resolution entity (since the template describes the resolution entity itself). This means that there will only be one column for each layer of the creditor hierarchy. 

Row 5 represents the subset of the amounts reported in row 4 that are TLAC-eligible according to the FSB TLAC Term Sheet (eg those that have a residual maturity of at least one year, are unsecured and if redeemable are not redeemable without SAMA approval). For the purposes of reporting this amount, the 2.5% cap (3.5% from 2022) on the exemption from the subordination requirement under the penultimate paragraph of Section 11 of the TLAC Term Sheet should be disapplied. That is, amounts that are ineligible solely as a result of the 2.5% cap (3.5%) should be included in full in row 5 together with amounts that are receiving recognition as TLAC. See also the second paragraph in Section 7 of the FSB TLAC Term Sheet.

Template CDC: Capital distribution constraints Purpose: To provide disclosure of the capital ratio(s) below which capital distribution constraints are triggered as required under the Basel framework (i.e. risk-based, leverage, etc.) to allow meaningful assessment by market participants of the likelihood of capital distributions becoming restricted. Scope of application The table is mandatory for banks. Where applicable, the template may include additional rows to accommodate other national requirements that could trigger capital distribution constraints. Content: Quantitative information. Includes the CET1 capital ratio that would trigger capital distribution constraints when taking into account (i) CET1 capital that banks must maintain to meet the minimum CET1 capital ratio, applicable risk based buffer requirements (i.e. capital conservation buffer, G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer) and Pillar 2 capital requirements (if CET1 capital is required); (ii) CET1 capital that banks must maintain to meet the minimum regulatory capital ratios and any CET1 capital used to meet Tier 1 capital, total capital and TLAC3 requirements, applicable risk-based buffer requirements (i.e. capital conservation buffer, G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer) and Pillar 2 capital requirements (if CET1 capital is required); and (iii) the leverage ratio inclusive of leverage ratio buffer requirement. Frequency: Annual. Format: Fixed. 

Accompanying narrative: In cases where capital distribution constraints have been imposed, banks should describe the constraints imposed. In addition, banks shall provide a link to the SAMA's website, where the characteristics governing capital distribution constraints are set out (eg stacking hierarchy of buffers, relevant time frame between breach of buffer and application of constraints, definition of earnings and distributable profits used to calculate restrictions). Further, banks may choose to provide any additional information they consider to be relevant for understanding the stated figures.

Explanation 

CET1 minimum plus Basel III buffers (not taking into account CET1 capital used to meet other minimum regulatory capital/TLAC ratios): CET1 capital ratio which would trigger capital distribution constraints, should the bank's CET1 capital ratio fall below this level. The ratio takes into account only CET1 capital that banks must maintain to meet the minimum CET1 capital ratio (4.5%), applicable risk-based buffer requirements (i.e. capital conservation buffer (2.5%), G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer) and Pillar 2 capital requirements (if CET1 capital is required). The ratio does not take into account instances where the bank has used its CET1 capital to meet its other minimum regulatory ratios (i.e. Tier 1 capital, total capital and/or TLAC requirements), which could increase the CET1 capital ratio which the bank has to meet in order to prevent capital distribution constraints from being triggered. CET1 minimum plus Basel III buffers (taking into account CET1 capital used to meet other minimum regulatory capital/TLAC ratios): CET1 capital ratio which would trigger capital distribution constraints, should the bank's CET1 capital ratio fall below this level. The ratio takes into account CET1 capital that banks must maintain to meet the minimum regulatory ratios (ie CET1, Tier 1, total capital requirements and TLAC requirements), applicable risk-based buffer requirements (i.e. capital conservation buffer (2.5%), G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer) and Pillar 2 capital requirements (if CET1 capital is required). 

Leverage ratio: Leverage ratio which would trigger capital distribution constraints, should the bank's leverage ratio fall below this level.

Template LI1: Differences between accounting and regulatory scopes of consolidation and mapping of financial statement categories with regulatory risk categories Purpose: Columns (a) and (b) enable users to identify the differences between the scope of accounting consolidation and the scope of regulatory consolidation; and columns (c)-(g) break down how the amounts reported in banks' financial statements (rows) correspond to regulatory risk categories. Scope of application: The template is mandatory for all banks. Content: Carrying values (corresponding to the values reported in financial statements). Frequency: Annual. Format: Flexible (but the rows must align with the presentation of the bank's financial report). Accompanying narrative: See Table LIA. Banks are expected to provide qualitative explanation on items that are subject to regulatory capital charges in more than one risk category.

Instructions 

Rows 

The rows must strictly follow the balance sheet presentation used by the bank in its financial reporting. 

Columns 

If a bank's scope of accounting consolidation and its scope of regulatory consolidation are exactly the same, columns (a) and (b) should be merged. 

The breakdown of regulatory categories (c) to (f) corresponds to the breakdown prescribed in the rest of SDIS, ie column (c) corresponds to the carrying values of items other than off-balance sheet items reported in section 19 column (d) corresponds to the carrying values of items other than off-balance sheet items reported in section 20, column (e) corresponds to carrying values of items in the banking book other than off-balance sheet items reported in section 21 and column (f) corresponds to the carrying values of items other than off-balance sheet items reported in section 22. 

Column (g) includes amounts not subject to capital requirements according to the Basel framework or subject to deductions from regulatory capital. 

Note: Where a single item attracts capital charges according to more than one risk category framework, it should be reported in all columns that it attracts a capital charge. As a consequence, the sum of amounts in columns (c) to (g) may not equal the amounts in column (b) as some items may be subject to regulatory capital charges in more than one risk category. 

For example, derivative assets/liabilities held in the regulatory trading book may relate to both column (d) and column (f). In such circumstances, the sum of the values in columns (c)-(g) would not equal to that in column (b). When amounts disclosed in two or more different columns are material and result in a difference between column (b) and the sum of columns (c)-(g), the reasons for this difference should be explained by banks in the accompanying narrative.

Template LI2: Main sources of differences between regulatory exposure amounts and carrying values in financial statements Purpose: Provide information on the main sources of differences (other than due to different scopes of consolidation which are shown in Template LI1) between the financial statements' carrying value amounts and the exposure amounts used for regulatory purposes. Scope of application: The template is mandatory for all banks. Content: Carrying values that correspond to values reported in financial statements but according to the scope of regulatory consolidation (rows 1-3) and amounts considered for regulatory exposure purposes (row 10). Frequency: Annual. Format: Flexible. Row headings shown below are provided for illustrative purposes only and should be adapted by the bank to describe the most meaningful drivers for differences between its financial statement carrying values and the amounts considered for regulatory purposes.

purposes 

Instructions 

Amounts in rows 1 and 2, columns (b)-(e) correspond to the amounts in columns (c)-(f) of Template LI1. 

Row 1 of Template LI2 includes only assets that are risk-weighted under the Basel framework, while row 2 includes liabilities that are considered for the application of the risk weighting requirements, either as short positions, trading or derivative liabilities, or through the application of the netting rules to calculate the net position of assets to be risk-weighted. These liabilities are not included in column (g) in Template LI1. Assets that are risk-weighted under the Basel framework include assets that are not deducted from capital because they are under the applicable thresholds or due to the netting with liabilities. 

Off-balance sheet amounts include off-balance sheet original exposure in column (a) and the amounts subject to regulatory framework, after application of the credit conversion factors (CCFs) where relevant in columns (b)-(d). 

Column (a) is not necessarily equal to the sum of columns (b)-(e) due to assets being risk-weighted more than once (see Template LI1). In addition, exposure values used for risk weighting may differ under each risk framework depending on whether standardized approaches or internal models are used in the computation of this exposure value. Therefore, for any type of risk framework, the exposure values under different regulatory approaches can be presented separately in each of the columns if a separate presentation eases the reconciliation of the exposure values for banks. 

The breakdown of columns in regulatory risk categories (b)-(e) corresponds to the breakdown prescribed in the rest of the document, ie column (b) credit risk corresponds to the exposures reported in section 19, column (c) corresponds to the exposures reported in section 21, column (d) corresponds to exposures reported in section 20, and column (e) corresponds to the exposures reported in section 22. 

Differences due to consideration of provisions: The exposure values under row 1 are the carrying amounts and hence net of provisions (ie specific and general provisions, as set out in SACAP2.2.3). Nevertheless, exposures under the foundation internal ratings-based (F-IRB) and advanced internal ratings-based (A-IRB) approaches are risk-weighted gross of provisions. Row 7 therefore is the re-inclusion of general and specific provisions in the carrying amount of exposures in the F-IRB and A-IRB approaches so that the carrying amount of those exposures is reconciled with their regulatory exposure value. Row 7 may also include the elements qualifying as general provisions that may have been deducted from the carrying amount of

exposures under the standardized approach and that therefore need to be reintegrated in the regulatory exposure value of those exposures. Any differences between the accounting impairment and the regulatory provisions under the Basel framework that have an impact on the exposure amounts considered for regulatory purposes should also be included in row 7. 

Exposure amounts considered for regulatory purposes: The expression designates the aggregate amount considered as a starting point of the RWA calculation for each of the risk categories. Under the credit risk framework this should correspond either to the exposure amount applied in the standardized approach for credit risk (see SCRE5) or to the exposures at default (EAD) in the IRB approach for credit risk (see SCRE12.29); securitization exposures should be defined as in the securitization framework (see SCRE18.4 and SCRE18.5); and counterparty credit exposures are defined as the EAD considered for counterparty credit risk purposes (see SCCR5). 

Linkages across templates 

Template LI2 is focused on assets in the regulatory scope of consolidation that are subject to the regulatory framework. Therefore, column (g) in Template LI1, which includes the elements of the balance sheet that are not subject to the regulatory framework, is not included in Template LI2. The following linkage holds: column (a) in Template LI2 = column (b) in Template LI1 - column (g) in Template LI1.

Template PV1: Prudent valuation adjustments (PVAs) Purpose: Provide a breakdown of the constituent elements of a bank's PVAs according to the requirements of Basel Framework "prudent valuation guidance", taking into account SAMA's circular No. 301000000768 on Supervisory guidance for assessing banks' financial instrument fair value practices, July 2009. 

Scope of application: The template is mandatory for all banks which record PVAs. 

Content: PVAs for all assets measured at fair value (marked to market or marked to model) and for which PVAs are required. Assets can be non-derivative or derivative instruments. 

Frequency: Annual. 

Format: Fixed. The row number cannot be altered. Rows which are not applicable to the reporting bank should be filled with "0" and the reason why 

they are not applicable should be explained in the accompanying narrative. 

Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant changes over the reporting period and the key drivers of such changes. In particular, banks are expected to detail "Other adjustments", where significant, and to define them when they are not listed in the Basel framework. Banks are also expected to explain the types of financial instruments for which the highest amounts of PVAs are observed.

Closeout cost: PVAs required to take account of the valuation uncertainty to adjust for the fact that the position level valuations calculated do not reflect an exit price for the position or portfolio (for example, where such valuations are calibrated to a mid-market price). Concentration: PVAs over and above market price and closeout costs that would be required to get to a prudent exit price for positions that are larger than the size of positions for which the valuation has been calculated (i.e. cases where the aggregate position held by the bank is larger than normal traded volume or larger than the position sizes on which observable quotes or trades that are used to calibrate the price or inputs used by the core valuation model are based). Early termination: PVAs to take into account the potential losses arising from contractual or non-contractual early terminations of customer trades that are not reflected in the valuation. Model risk: PVAs to take into account valuation model risk which arises due to: (i) the potential existence of a range of different models or model calibrations which are used by users of Pillar 3 data; (ii) the lack of a firm exit price for the specific product being valued; (iii) the use of an incorrect valuation methodology; (iv) the risk of using unobservable and possibly incorrect calibration parameters; or (v) the fact that market or product factors are not captured by the core valuation model. Operational risk: PVAs to take into account the potential losses that may be incurred as a result of operational risk related to valuation processes. 

Investing and funding costs: PVAs to reflect the valuation uncertainty in the funding costs that other users of Pillar 3 data would factor into the exit price for a position or portfolio. It includes funding valuation adjustments on derivatives exposures. 

Unearned credit spreads: PVAs to take account of the valuation uncertainty in the adjustment necessary to include the current value of expected losses due to counterparty default on derivative positions, including the valuation uncertainty on CVA. 

Future administrative costs: PVAs to take into account the administrative costs and future hedging costs over the expected life of the exposures for which a direct exit price is not applied for the closeout costs. This valuation adjustment has to include the operational costs arising from hedging, administration and settlement of contracts in the portfolio. The future administrative costs are incurred by the portfolio or position but are not reflected in the core valuation model or the prices used to calibrate inputs to that model. Other: "Other" PVAs which are required to take into account factors that will influence the exit price but which do not fall in any of the categories listed in Basel Framework "prudent valuation guidance" (Introduction). These should be described by banks in the narrative commentary that supports the disclosure.

17.1 The disclosure requirement under this section is: Template ENC - Asset 

encumbrance. 

17.2 Template ENC provides information on the encumbered and unencumbered assets 

of a bank. 

17.3 The definition of "encumbered assets" in Template ENC is different to that under LCR30 for on-balance sheet assets. Specifically, the definition of "encumbered assets" in Template ENC excludes the aspect of asset monetization. Under Template ENC, "encumbered assets" are assets that the bank is restricted or prevented from liquidating, selling, transferring or assigning, due to regulatory, contractual or other limitations.

Template ENC: Asset encumbrance Purpose: To provide the amount of encumbered and unencumbered assets. Scope of application The template is mandatory for all banks. Content: Carrying amount for encumbered and unencumbered assets on the balance sheet using period-end values. Banks must use the specific definition of "encumbered assets" set out in the instructions below in making the disclosure. The scope of consolidation for the purposes of this disclosure requirement should be a bank's regulatory scope of consolidation, but including its securitization exposures. Frequency: Semiannual. Format: Fixed. Banks should always complete columns (a), (b) and (c). 

Banks should group any assets used in central bank facilities with other encumbered and unencumbered assets, as appropriate. Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain (i) any significant change in the amount of encumbered and unencumbered assets from the previous disclosure; (ii) as applicable, any definition of the amounts of encumbered and/or unencumbered assets broken down by types of transaction/category; and (iii) any other relevant information necessary to understand the context of the disclosed figures.

The definitions are specific to this template and are not applicable for other parts of the Basel framework. 

Encumbered assets: Encumbered assets are assets that the bank is restricted or prevented from liquidating, selling, transferring or assigning due to legal, regulatory, contractual or other limitations. The definition of "encumbered assets" in Template ENC is different than that under the Liquidity Coverage Ratio for on-balance sheet assets. Specifically, the definition of "encumbered assets" in Template ENC excludes the aspect of asset monetization. For an unencumbered asset to qualify as high-quality liquid assets, the LCR requires a bank to have the ability to monetize that asset during the stress period such that the bank can meet net cash outflows. 

Unencumbered assets: Unencumbered assets are assets which do not meet the definition of encumbered. 

Instructions 

Total (in column (c)): Sum of encumbered and unencumbered assets. The scope of consolidation for the purposes of this disclosure requirement should be based on a bank's regulatory scope of consolidation, but including its securitization exposures.

Definitions Gross carrying values: on- and off-balance sheet items that give rise to a credit risk exposure according to the Basel framework. On-balance sheet items include loans and debt securities. Off-balance sheet items must be measured according to the following criteria: (a) guarantees given - the maximum amount that the bank would have to pay if the guarantee were called. The amount must be gross of any credit conversion factor (CCF) or credit risk mitigation (CRM) techniques. (b) Irrevocable loan commitments - total amount that the bank has committed to lend. The amount must be gross of any CCF or CRM techniques. Revocable loan commitments must not be included. The gross value is the accounting value before any allowance/impairments but after considering write-offs. Banks must not take into account any credit risk mitigation technique. 

Write-offs for the purpose of this template are related to a direct reduction of the carrying amount when the entity has no reasonable expectations of recovery. 

Defaulted exposures: banks should use the definition of default that they also use for regulatory purposes. Banks must provide this definition of default in the accompanying narrative. For a bank using the standardized approach for credit risk, the default exposures in Templates CR1 and CR2 should correspond to exposures that are "past due for more than 90 days", as stated in SCRE7.96. 

Non-defaulted exposures: any exposure not meeting the above definition of default. 

Allowances/impairments: are those that are considered "credit-impaired" in the meaning of IFRS 9 Appendix A. 

Accounting provisions for credit losses: total amount of provisions, made via an allowance against impaired and not impaired exposures according to the applicable accounting framework. For example, when the accounting framework is IFRS 9, "impaired exposures" are those that are considered "credit-impaired" in the meaning of IFRS 9 Appendix A. When the accounting framework is US GAAP, "impaired exposures" are those exposures for which credit losses are measured under ASC Topic 326 and for which the bank has recorded a partial write-off/write-down. 

Banks must fill in column d to f in accordance with the categorization of accounting provisions distinguishing those meeting the conditions to be categorized in general provisions, as defined in SACAP2.2.3, and those that are categorized as specific provisions. This categorization must be consistent with information provided in Table CRB. Net values: Total gross value less allowances/impairments. 

Debt securities: Debt securities exclude equity investments subject to the credit risk framework. However, banks may add a row between rows 2 and 3 for "other investment" (if needed) and explain in the accompanying narrative. 

Linkages across templates Amount in [CR1:1/g] is equal to the sum [CR3:1/a] + [CR3:1/b]. Amount in [CR1:2/g] is equal to the sum [CR3:2/a] + [CR3:2/b]. Amount in [CR1:4/a] is equal to [CR2:6/a], only when (i) there is zero defaulted off-balance sheet exposure or SAMA has exercised its discretion to include off-balance sheet exposures in Template CR2.

Table CR2: Changes in stock of defaulted loans and debt securities 

Purpose: Identify the changes in a bank's stock of defaulted exposures, the flows between non-defaulted and defaulted exposure categories and reductions in the stock of defaulted exposures due to write-offs. Scope of application: The template is mandatory for all banks. Content: Carrying values. Frequency: Semiannual. Format: Fixed. Accompanying narrative: Banks should explain the drivers of any significant changes in the amounts of defaulted exposures from the previous reporting period and any significant movement between defaulted and non-defaulted loans. Banks should disclose in their accompanying narrative whether defaulted exposures include off-balance sheet items.

(1+2-3-4+5) 

Definitions 

Defaulted exposure: such exposures must be reported net of write-offs and gross of (ie ignoring) allowances/impairments. For a bank using the standardised approach for credit risk, the default exposures in Templates CR1 and CR2 should correspond to exposures that are "past due for more than 90 days", as stated in SCRE7.96. 

Loans and debt securities that have defaulted since the last reporting period: refers to any loan or debt securities that became marked as defaulted during the reporting period. 

Return to non-defaulted status: refers to loans or debt securities that returned to non-default status during the reporting period. 

Amounts written off: both total and partial write-offs. 

Other changes: balancing items that are necessary to enable total to reconcile.

Scope of application: The table is mandatory for all banks. Content: Additional qualitative and quantitative information (carrying values). Frequency: Annual. Format: Flexible. 

Banks must provide the following disclosures: 

Qualitative disclosures 

(a) 

The scope and definitions of "past due" and "impaired" exposures used for accounting purposes and the differences, if any, between the definition of past due and default for accounting and regulatory purposes. When the accounting framework is IFRS 9, "impaired exposures" are those that are considered "credit-impaired" in the meaning of IFRS 9 Appendix A. 

(b) 

The extent of past-due exposures (more than 90 days) that are not considered to be impaired and the reasons for this. 

(c) 

Description of methods used for determining accounting provisions for credit losses. In addition, banks that have adopted an ECL accounting model must provide information on the rationale for categorisation of ECL accounting provisions in general and specific categories for standardised approach exposures. 

(d) 

The bank's own definition of a restructured exposure. Banks should disclose the definition of restructured exposures they use (which may be a definition from the local accounting or regulatory framework). 

Quantitative disclosures 

(e) 

Breakdown of exposures by geographical areas, industry and residual maturity. 

(f) 

Amounts of impaired exposures (according to the definition used by the bank for accounting purposes) and related accounting provisions, broken down by geographical areas and industry.

Table CRB-A - Additional disclosure related to prudential treatment of problem assets Purpose: To supplement the quantitative templates with additional information related to non-performing exposures and forbearance. Scope of application: The table is mandatory for banks. Content: Qualitative and quantitative information (carrying values corresponding to the accounting values reported in financial statements but according to the regulatory scope of consolidation) Frequency: Annual. Format: Flexible. Banks must provide the following disclosures: 

Qualitative disclosures 

a) 

b) 

The bank's own definition of non-performing exposures. The bank should specify in particular if it is using the definition provided in the guidelines on prudential treatment of problem assets (hereafter in this table referred to as SAMA's Rules on Management of Problem No. 41033343, January 2020. And provide a discussion on the implementation of its definition, including the materiality threshold used to categorise exposures as past due, the exit criteria of the non-performing category (providing information on a probation period, if relevant), together with any useful information for users' understanding of this categorisation. This would include a discussion of any differences or unique processes for the categorisation of corporate and retail loans. The bank's own definition of a forborne exposure. The bank should specify in particular if it is using the definition provided in the Guidelines and provide a discussion on the implementation of its definition, including the exit criteria of the restructured or forborne category (providing information on the probation period, if relevant), together with any useful information for users' understanding of this categorisation.

d) 

Gross carrying value of total performing as well as non-performing exposures, broken down first by debt securities, loans and off-balance sheet exposures. Loans should be further broken down by corporate and retail exposures. Non-performing exposures should in addition be split into (i) defaulted exposures and/or impaired exposures;5 (ii) exposures that are not defaulted/impaired exposures but are more than 90 days past due; and (iii) other exposures where there is evidence that full repayment is unlikely without the bank's realisation of collateral (which would include exposures that are not defaulted/impaired and are not more than 90 days past due but for which payment is unlikely without the bank's realisation of collateral, even if the exposures are not past due). Value adjustments and provisions6 or non-performing exposures should also be disclosed. Gross carrying values of restructured/forborne exposures broken down first by debt securities, loans and off-balance sheet exposures. Loans should be further broken down by corporate and retail exposures to enable an understanding of material differences in the level of risk among different portfolios (eg retail exposures secured by real estate/mortages, revolving exposures, SMEs, other retail). Exposures should, in addition, be split into performing and non-performing, and impaired and not impaired exposures. Value adjustments and provisions for non-performing exposures should also be disclosed. 

4 Banks are allowed to (i) merge row (d) of Table CRB with row (b) of Table CRB-A and (ii) merge row (h) of Table CRB with row (d) of Table CRB-A if and only if the bank uses a common definition for restructured and forborne exposures. The bank should clarify in the disclosure that they are applying a common definition for restructured and forborne exposures. In such case, the bank should also specify in the accompanying narrative that it uses a common definition for restructured exposures and forborne exposures that therefore, information disclosed regarding requirements of row (b) and row (d) of Table CRB-A have been merged with the row (d) and row (h) of Table CRB, respectively. 

5 When the accounting framework is IFRS 9, "impaired exposures" are those that are considered "credit-impaired" in the meaning of IFRS 9 Appendix A. 

6 Please refer to paragraph 33 of the Guidelines, where it is stated: "these value adjustments and provisions refer to both the allowance for credit losses and direct reductions of the outstanding of an exposure to reflect a decline in the counterparty's creditworthiness". For banks not applying the Guidelines, please refer to the definition of accounting provisions included in Template CR1, which is in line with paragraph 33 of the Guidelines.

Definitions 

Gross carrying values: on- and off-balance sheet items that give rise to a credit risk exposure according to the finalised Basel III framework. On-balance sheet items include loans and debt securities. Off-balance sheet items must be measured according to the following criteria: a) Guarantees given - the maximum amount that the bank would have to pay if the guarantee were called. The amount must be gross of 

any credit conversion factor (CCF) or credit risk mitigation (CRM) techniques. 

b) 

Irrevocable loan commitments - the total amount that the bank has committed to lend. The amount must be gross of any CCF or CRM techniques. Revocable loan commitments must not be included. The gross value is the accounting value before any allowance/impairments but after considering write-offs. Banks must not take into account any CRM technique.

Table CRC: Qualitative disclosure related to credit risk mitigation techniques Purpose: Provide qualitative information on the mitigation of credit risk. Scope of application: The table is mandatory for all banks. Content: Qualitative information. Frequency: Annual. Format: Flexible. 

Banks must disclose: 

(a) 

Core features of policies and processes for, and an indication of the extent to which the bank makes use of, on- and off-balance sheet netting. 

(b) Core features of policies and processes for collateral evaluation and management. 

Information about market or credit risk concentrations under the credit risk mitigation instruments used (ie by guarantor type, collateral and credit derivative providers). 

(c) 

Banks should disclose a meaningful breakdown of their credit derivative providers, and set the level of granularity of this breakdown in accordance with section 10. For instance, banks are not required to identify their derivative counterparties nominally if the name of the counterparty is considered to be confidential information. Instead, the credit derivative exposure can be broken down by rating class or by type of counterparty (eg banks, other financial institutions, non-financial institutions).

Table CR3: Credit risk mitigation techniques - overview Purpose: Disclose the extent of use of credit risk mitigation techniques. Scope of application: The table is mandatory for all banks. Content: Carrying values. Banks must include all CRM techniques used to reduce capital requirements and disclose all secured exposures, irrespective of whether the standardised or IRB approach is used for RWA calculation. Please refer to section 28.3 for an illustration on how the template should be completed. Frequency: Semiannual. Format: Fixed. Where banks are unable to categorise exposures secured by collateral, financial guarantees or credit derivative into "loans" and "debt securities", they can either (i) merge two corresponding cells, or (ii) divide the amount by the pro-rata weight of gross carrying values; they must explain which method they have used. Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant changes over the reporting period and the key drivers of such changes.

Exposures unsecured- carrying amount: carrying amount of exposures (net of allowances/impairments) that do not benefit from a credit risk mitigation technique. 

Exposures to be secured: carrying amount of exposures which have at least one credit risk mitigation mechanism (collateral, financial guarantees, credit derivatives) associated with them. The allocation of the carrying amount of multi-secured exposures to their different credit risk mitigation mechanisms is made by order of priority, starting with the credit risk mitigation mechanism expected to be called first in the event of loss, and within the limits of the carrying amount of the secured exposures. 

Exposures secured by collateral: carrying amount of exposures (net of allowances/impairments) partly or totally secured by collateral. In case an exposure is secured by collateral and other credit risk mitigation mechanism(s), the carrying amount of the exposures secured by collateral is the remaining share of the exposure secured by collateral after consideration of the shares of the exposure already secured by other mitigation mechanisms expected to be called beforehand in the event of a loss, without considering overcollateralisation. 

Exposures secured by financial guarantees: carrying amount of exposures (net of allowances/impairments) partly or totally secured by financial guarantees. In case an exposure is secured by financial guarantees and other credit risk mitigation mechanism, the carrying amount of the exposure secured by financial guarantees is the remaining share of the exposure secured by financial guarantees after consideration of the shares of the exposure already secured by other mitigation mechanisms expected to be called beforehand in the event of a loss, without considering overcollateralisation.

Table CRD: Qualitative disclosure on banks' use of external credit ratings under the standardised approach for credit risk Purpose: Supplement the information on a bank's use of the standardised approach with qualitative data on the use of external ratings. Scope of application: The table is mandatory for all banks that: (a) use the credit risk standardised approach (or the simplified standardised approach); and (b) make use of external credit ratings for their RWA calculation. 

In order to provide meaningful information to users, the bank may choose not to disclose the information requested in the table if the exposures and RWA amounts are negligible. It is however required to explain why it considers the information not to be meaningful to users, including a description of the portfolios concerned and the aggregate total RWA these portfolios represent. Content: Qualitative information. Frequency: Annual. Format: Flexible. 

A. For portfolios that are risk-weighted under the standardised approach for credit risk, banks must disclose the following information: 

(a) Names of the external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs); 

(b) The asset classes for which each ECAI is used; 

(c) 

A description of the process used to transfer the issuer to issue credit ratings onto comparable assets in the banking book (see SCRE8.16 to SCRE8.18); and 

(d) The alignment of the alphanumerical scale of each agency used with risk buckets (as per SAMA circular No. B.C.S 242, issued April 11, 2007).

Template CR4: Standardised approach - credit risk exposure and credit risk mitigation (CRM) effects Purpose: To illustrate the effect of CRM (comprehensive and simple approach) on capital requirement calculations under the standardised approach for credit risk. RWA density provides a synthetic metric on the riskiness of each portfolio. Scope of application: The template is mandatory for banks using the standardised approach for credit risk. Subject to SAMA approval of the immateriality of the asset class, banks that intend to adopt a phased rollout of the IRB approach may apply the standardised approach to certain asset classes. In circumstances where exposures and RWA amounts subject to the standardised approach may be considered to be negligible, and disclosure of this information to users would not provide any meaningful information, the bank may choose not to disclose the template for the exposures treated under the standardised approach. The bank must, however, explain why it considers the information not to be meaningful to users. The explanation must include a description of the exposures included in the respective portfolios and the aggregate total of RWA from such exposures. Content: Regulatory exposure amounts Frequency: Semiannual. Format: Fixed. The columns and rows cannot be altered unless SAMA make policy changes to the asset classes as defined under the finalised Basel III framework. Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant change over the reporting period and the key drivers of such changes. Banks should describe the sequence in which CCFs, provisioning and credit risk mitigation measures are applied.

7 The prohibition on the use of the IRB approach for equity exposures will be subject to a five-year linear phase-in arrangement from 1 January 2022 (please see SCRE17.1 and SCRE17.2). During this phase-in period, the risk weight for equity exposures will be the greater of: (i) the risk weight as calculated under the IRB approach, and (ii) the risk weight set for the linear phase-in arrangement under the standardised approach for credit risk. Alternatively, SAMA may require banks to apply the fully phased-in standardised approach treatment from the date of implementation of this standard. Accordingly, for disclosure purposes, banks that continue to apply the IRB approach during the phase-in period should report their equity exposures in either the 250% or the 400% column, according to whether the respective equity exposures are speculative unlisted equities or all other equities. 

8 For disclosure purposes, banks that use the standardised approach for credit risk during the transitional period should report their equity exposures according to whether they would be classified as "other equity holdings" (250%) or "speculative unlisted equity" (400%). Risk weights disclosed for "speculative unlisted equity exposures" and "other equity holdings" should reflect the actual risk weights applied to these exposures in a particular year (please refer to the respective transitional arrangements set out in SCRE17.1)

Template CRE: Qualitative disclosure related to IRB models Purpose: Provide additional information on IRB models used to compute RWA. Scope of application: he table is mandatory for banks using A-IRB or F-IRB approaches for some or all of their exposures. To provide meaningful information to users, the bank must describe the main characteristics of the models used at the group-wide level (according to the scope of regulatory consolidation) and explain how the scope of models described was determined. The commentary must include the percentage of RWA covered by the models for each of the bank's regulatory portfolios. Content: Qualitative information. Frequency: Annual. Format: Flexible. 

Banks must provide the following information on their use of IRB models: 

(a) 

Internal model development, controls and changes: role of the functions involved in the development, approval and subsequent changes of the credit risk models. 

(b) 

Relationships between risk management function and internal audit function and procedure to ensure the independence of the function in charge of the review of the models from the functions responsible for the development of the models. 

(c) Scope and main content of the reporting related to credit risk models. 

Scope of the supervisor's acceptance of approach. 

(d) 

(e) 

The "scope of the supervisor's acceptance of approach" refers to the scope of internal models approved by SAMA in terms of entities within the group (if applicable), portfolios and exposure classes, with a breakdown between foundation IRB (F-IRB) and advanced IRB (A-IRB), if applicable. For each of the portfolios, the bank must indicate the part of EAD within the group (in percentage of total EAD) covered by standardised, F-IRB and A-IRB approach and the part of portfolios that are involved in a roll-out plan. 

(f) The number of key models used with respect to each portfolio, with a brief discussion of the main differences among the models within the same portfolios. 

Description of the main characteristics of the approved models: (i) definitions, methods and data for estimation and validation of PD (eg how PDs are estimated for low default portfolios; if there are regulatory floors; the drivers for differences observed between PD and actual default rates at least for the last three periods); 

(g) 

and where applicable: 

(ii) LGD (eg methods to calculate downturn LGD; how LGDs are estimated for low default portfolio; the time lapse between the default event and the closure of the exposure); (iii) credit conversion factors, including assumptions employed in the derivation of these variables;

Template CR9: IRB - Backtesting of probability of default (PD) per portfolio Purpose: Provide backtesting data to validate the reliability of PD calculations. In particular, the template compares the PD used in IRB capital calculations with the effective default rates of bank obligors. A minimum five-year average annual default rate is required to compare the PD with a "more stable" default rate, although a bank may use a longer historical period that is consistent with its actual risk management practices. Scope of application: he template is mandatory for banks using the A-IRB and/or F-IRB approaches. Where a bank makes use of a F-IRB approach for certain exposures and an A-IRB approach for others, it must disclose two separate sets of portfolio breakdown in separate templates. 

To provide meaningful information to users on the backtesting of their internal models through this template, the bank must include in this template the key models used at the group-wide level (according to the scope of regulatory consolidation) and explain how the scope of models described was determined. The commentary must include the percentage of RWA covered by the models for which backtesting results are shown here for each of the bank's regulatory portfolios. 

The models to be disclosed refer to any model, or combination of models, approved SAMA, for the generation of the PD used for calculating capital requirements under the IRB approach. This may include the model that is used to assign a risk rating to an obligor, and/or the model that calibrates the internal ratings to the PD scale. Content: Modelling parameters used in IRB calculation. Frequency: Annual. Format: Flexible. Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant changes over the reporting period and the key drivers of such changes. Banks may wish to supplement the template when disclosing the amount of exposure and the number of obligors whose defaulted exposures have been cured in the year.

(i) Sovereign; (ii) Banks; (iii) Corporate; (iv) Corporate - Specialised Lending; (v) Retail - QRRE; (vi) Retail - Residential mortgage exposures; (vii) Retail - SME; (viii) Other retail exposures; (ix) Purchased receivables. 

External rating equivalent: refers to external ratings that may be available for retail borrowers. This may, for instance, be the case for small or medium-sized entities (SMEs) that fit the requirements to be included in the retail portfolios which could have an external rating, or a credit score or a range of credit scores provided by a consumer credit bureau. One column has to be filled in for each rating agency authorised for prudential purposes in the jurisdictions where the bank operates. However, where such external ratings are not available, they need not be provided. 

Weighted average PD: the same as reported in Template CR6. These are the estimated PDs assigned by the internal model authorised under the IRB approaches. The PD values are EAD-weighted and the "weight" is the EAD at the beginning of the period. 

Arithmetic average PD by obligors: PD within range by number of obligor within the range. The average PD by obligors is the simple average: Arithmetic average PD = sum of PDs of all accounts (transactions) / number of accounts. 

Number of obligors: two sets of information are required: (i) the number of obligors at the end of the previous year; (ii) the number of obligors at the end of the year subject to reporting; 

Defaulted obligors in the year: number of defaulted obligors during the year; of which: new obligors defaulted in the year: number of obligors having defaulted during the last 12-month period that were not funded at the end of the previous financial year; 

Average historical annual default rate: the five-year average of the annual default rate (obligors at the beginning of each year that are defaulted during that year/total obligor hold at the beginning of the year) is a minimum. The bank may use a longer historical period that is consistent with the bank's actual risk management practices. The disclosed average historical annual default rate disclosed should be before the application of the margin of conservatism.

Definitions SA-CCR (for derivatives): Banks should report SA-CCR in row 1. 

Replacement Cost (RC): For trades that are not subject to margining requirements, the RC is the loss that would occur if a counterparty were to default and was closed out of its transactions immediately. For margined trades, it is the loss that would occur if a counterparty were to default at present or at a future date, assuming that the closeout and replacement of transactions occur instantaneously. However, closeout of a trade upon a counterparty default may not be instantaneous. The replacement cost under the standardised approach for measuring counterparty credit risk exposures is described in SCCR6. 

Potential Future Exposure is any potential increase in exposure between the present and up to the end of the margin period of risk. The potential future exposure for the standardised approach is described in SCCR3. 

Effective Expected Positive Exposure (EPE) is the weighted average over time of the effective expected exposure over the first year, or, if all the contracts in the netting set mature before one year, over the time period of the longest-maturity contract in the netting set where the weights are the proportion that an individual expected exposure represents of the entire time interval (see SCCR3). 

EAD post-CRM: exposure at default. This refers to the amount relevant for the capital requirements calculation having applied CRM techniques, credit valuation adjustments according to SCCR5.10 and specific wrong-way adjustments (see SCCR7).

Template CCR3: Standardised approach - CCR exposures by regulatory portfolio and risk weights Purpose: Provide a breakdown of counterparty credit risk exposures calculated according to the standardised approach: by portfolio (type of counterparties) and by risk weight (riskiness attributed according to standardised approach). Scope of application: The template is mandatory for all banks using the credit risk standardised approach to compute RWA for counterparty credit risk exposures, irrespective of the CCR approach used to determine exposure at default. 

If a bank deems that the information requested in this template is not meaningful to users because the exposures and RWA amounts are negligible, the bank may choose not to disclose the template. The bank is, however, required to explain in a narrative commentary why it considers the information not to be meaningful to users, including a description of the exposures in the portfolios concerned and the aggregate total of RWAs amount from such exposures. Content: Credit exposure amounts. Frequency: Semiannual. Format: Fixed. Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant changes over the reporting period and the key drivers of such changes.

Template CCR4: IRB - CCR exposures by portfolio and PD scale Purpose: Provide all relevant parameters used for the calculation of counterparty credit risk capital requirements for IRB models. Scope of application: The template is mandatory for banks using an advanced IRB (A-IRB) or foundation IRB (F-IRB) approach to compute RWA for counterparty credit risk exposures, whatever CCR approach is used to determine exposure at default. Where a bank makes use of an FIRB approach for certain exposures and an AIRB approach for others, it must disclose two separate sets of portfolio breakdown in two separate templates. 

To provide meaningful information, the bank must include in this template the key models used at the group-wide level (according to the scope of regulatory consolidation) and explain how the scope of models described in this template was determined. The commentary must include the percentage of RWAs covered by the models shown here for each of the bank's regulatory portfolios. Content: RWA and parameters used in RWA calculations for exposures subject to the counterparty credit risk framework (excluding CVA charges or exposures cleared through a CCP) and where the credit risk approach used to compute RWA is an IRB approach. Frequency: Semiannual. Format: Fixed. Columns and PD scales in the rows are fixed. However, the portfolio breakdown shown in the rows will be set by SAMA to reflect the exposure categories required under local implementations of IRB approaches.

Definitions Collateral used is defined as referring to both legs of the transaction. Example: a bank transfers securities to a third party, and the third party in turn posts collateral to the bank. The bank reports both legs of the transaction. The collateral received is reported in column (e), while the collateral posted by the bank is reported in column (f). The fair value of collateral received or posted must be after any haircut. This means the value of collateral received will be reduced by the haircut (ie C(1 - Hs)) and collateral posted will be increased after the haircut (ie E(1 + Hs)). 

Segregated refers to collateral which is held in a bankruptcy-remote manner according to the description included in SCCR8.18 to SCCR8.23. 

Unsegregated refers to collateral that is not held in a bankruptcy-remote manner. 

Domestic sovereign debt refers to the sovereign debt of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the bank, or, when disclosures are made on a consolidated basis, the jurisdiction of incorporation of the parent company. 

Domestic currency refers to items of collateral that are denominated in the bank's (consolidated) reporting currency and not the transaction currency.

A qualifying central counterparty (QCCP) is an entity that is licensed to operate as a CCP (including a licence granted by way of confirming an exemption), and is permitted by the appropriate regulator/overseer to operate as such with respect to the products offered. This is subject to the provision that the CCP is based and prudentially supervised in a jurisdiction where the relevant regulator/overseer has established, and publicly indicated, that it applies to the CCP on an ongoing basis, domestic rules and regulations that are consistent with the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and International Organization of Securities Commissions' Principles for Financial Market Infrastructures. See SCCR8 for the comprehensive definition and associated criteria. 

Initial margin means a clearing member's or client's funded collateral posted to the CCP to mitigate the potential future credit exposure of the CCP to the clearing member arising from the possible future change in the value of their transactions. For the purposes of this template, initial margin does not include contributions to a CCP for mutualised loss-sharing arrangements (ie in cases where a CCP uses initial margin to mutualise losses among the clearing members, it will be treated as a default fund exposure). 

Prefunded default fund contributions are prefunded clearing member contributions towards, or underwriting of, a CCP's mutualised loss-sharing arrangements. 

Unfunded default fund contributions are unfunded clearing member contributions towards, or underwriting of, a CCP's mutualised loss-sharing arrangements. If a bank is not a clearing member but a client of a clearing member, it should include its exposures to unfunded default fund contributions if applicable. Otherwise, banks should leave this row empty and explain the reason in the accompanying narrative. 

Segregated refers to collateral which is held in a bankruptcy-remote manner according to the description included in SCCR8.18 to SCCR8.23. 

Unsegregated refers to collateral that is not held in a bankruptcy-remote manner.

21. Securitisation: 

21.1 This chapter describes the disclosure requirements applying to securitisation 

exposures. 

21.2 The scope of this section:11 

21.2.1 Covers all securitisation exposures12 in Table SECA and in templates SEC1 

and SEC2; 

21.2.2 Focuses on banking book securitisation exposures subject to capital charges according to the securitisation framework in templates SEC3 and SEC4; and 

21.2.3 Excludes capital charges related to securitisation positions in the trading 

book that are reported in section 22. 

21.3 Only securitisation exposures that the bank treats under the securitisation framework (SCRE18 to SCRE22) are disclosed in templates SEC3 and SEC4. For banks acting as originators, this implies that the criteria for risk transfer recognition as described in SCRE18.24 to SCRE18.29 are met. Conversely, all securitisation exposures, including those that do not meet the risk transfer recognition criteria, are reported in templates SEC1 and SEC2. As a result, templates SEC1 and SEC2 may include exposures that are subject to capital requirements according to both the credit risk and market risk frameworks and that are also included in other parts of the Pillar 3 report. The purpose is to provide a comprehensive view of banks' securitisation activities. There is no double-counting of capital requirements as templates SEC3 and SEC4 are limited to exposures subject to the securitisation framework. 

21.4 The disclosure requirements under this section are: 

21.4.1 Table SECA - Qualitative disclosure requirements related to securitisation 

exposures 

11 Unless stated otherwise, all terms used in section 21 are used consistently with the definitions in SCRE18. 

12 Securitisation refers to the definition of what constitutes a securitisation under the Basel framework. Securitisation exposures correspond to securitisation exposures as defined in the Basel framework. According to this framework, securitisation exposures can include, but are not restricted to, the following: asset-backed securities, mortgage-backed securities, credit enhancements, liquidity facilities, interest rate or currency swaps, credit derivatives and tranched cover as described in SCRE9. Reserve accounts, such as cash collateral accounts, recorded as an asset by the originating bank must also be treated as securitisation exposures. Securitisation exposures refer to retained or purchased exposures and not to underlying pools.

Table SECA: Qualitative disclosure requirements related to securitisation exposures Purpose: Provide qualitative information on a bank's strategy and risk management with respect to its securitisation activities. 

Scope of application: The table is mandatory for all banks with securitisation exposures. 

Content: Qualitative information. 

Frequency: Annually. 

Format: Flexible. 

Qualitative disclosures 

(A) Banks must describe their risk management objectives and policies for securitisation activities and main features of these activities according to the framework below. If a bank holds securitisation positions reflected both in the regulatory banking book and in the regulatory trading book, the bank must describe each of the following points by distinguishing activities in each of the regulatory books. 

(a) 

The bank's objectives in relation to securitisation and re-securitisation activity, including the extent to which these activities transfer credit risk of the underlying securitised exposures away from the bank to other entities, the type of risks assumed and the types of risks retained. The bank must provide a list of: 

(b) 

(c) 

(d) 

(e) 

 special purpose entities (SPEs) where the bank acts as sponsor (but not as an originator such as an Asset Backed Commercial Paper (ABCP) conduit), indicating whether the bank consolidates the SPEs into its scope of regulatory consolidation. A bank would generally be considered a "sponsor" if it, in fact or in substance, manages or advises the programme, places securities into the market, or provides liquidity and/or credit enhancements. The programme may include, for example, ABCP conduit programmes and structured investment vehicles. 

 affiliated entities (i) that the bank manages or advises and (ii) that invest either in the securitisation exposures that the bank has 

securitised or in SPEs that the bank sponsors. 

 a list of entities to which the bank provides implicit support and the associated capital impact for each of them (as required in 

SCRE18.14 and SCRE18.49. 

Summary of the bank's accounting policies for securitisation activities. Where relevant, banks are expected to distinguish securitisation exposures from re-securitisation exposures. 

If applicable, the names of external credit assessment institution (ECAIs) used for securitisations and the types of securitisation exposure for which each agency is used. If applicable, describe the process for implementing the Basel internal assessment approach (IAA). The description should include: 

 structure of the internal assessment process and relation between internal assessment and external ratings, including information on 

ECAIs as referenced in item (d) of this table. 

 control mechanisms for the internal assessment process including discussion of independence, accountability, and internal 

 

assessment process review. the exposure type to which the internal assessment process is applied; and stress factors used for determining credit enhancement levels, by exposure type. For example, credit cards, home equity, auto, and securitisation exposures detailed by underlying exposure type and security type (eg residential mortgage-backed securities, commercial mortgage-backed securities, asset-backed securities, collateralised debt obligations) etc. 

(f) 

Banks must describe the use of internal assessment other than for SEC-IAA capital purposes.

Definitions (i) When the "bank acts as originator" the securitisation exposures are the retained positions, even where not eligible for the securitisation framework due to the absence of significant and effective risk transfer (which may be presented separately). (ii) When "the bank acts as sponsor", the securitisation exposures include exposures to commercial paper conduits to which the bank provides programme-wide enhancements, liquidity and other facilities. Where the bank acts both as originator and sponsor, it must avoid double-counting. In this regard, the bank can merge the two columns of "bank acts as originator" and "bank acts as sponsor" and use "bank acts as originator/sponsor" columns. (iii) Securitisation exposures when "the bank acts as an investor" are the investment positions purchased in third-party deals. Synthetic transactions: if the bank has purchased protection it must report the net exposure amounts to which it is exposed under columns originator/sponsor (ie the amount that is not secured). If the bank has sold protection, the exposure amount of the credit protection must be reported in the "investor" column. Re-securitisation: all securitisation exposures related to re-securitisation must be completed in rows "re-securitisation", and not in the preceding rows (by type of underlying asset) which contain only securitisation exposures other than re-securitisation.

22.2.2 Market risk under the internal models approach (IMA): 

Table MRB: Qualitative disclosures for banks using the IMA Purpose: Provide the scope, main characteristics and key modelling choices of the different models used for the capital requirement computation of 

market risks using the IMA. 

Scope of application: The table is mandatory for all banks using the IMA to calculate the market risk capital requirements. To provide meaningful 

information to users on a bank's use of internal models, the bank must describe the main characteristics of the models used at the group-wide level 

(according to the scope of regulatory consolidation) and explain the extent to which they represent all the models used at the group-wide level. The 

commentary must include the percentage of capital requirements covered by the models described for each of the regulatory models (expected shortfall 

(ES), default risk capital (DRC) requirement and stressed expected shortfall (SES) for non-modellable risk factors (NMRFs)). 

Content: Quantitative information. 

Frequency: Annual. 

Format: Flexible. 

(A) Banks must provide a general description of the trading desk structure (as defined in SMAR4) and types of instruments included in the IMA trading 

desks. 

(B) For ES models, banks must provide the following information: 

(a) A description of trading desks covered by the ES models. Where applicable, banks must also describe the main trading desks not included in ES regulatory calculations (due to lack of historical data or model constraints) and treated under other measures (such as specific treatments allowed in some jurisdictions). 

(b) The soundness criteria on which the internal capital adequacy assessment is based (eg forward-looking stress testing) and a description of the 

methodologies used to achieve a capital adequacy assessment that is consistent with the soundness standards. 

(c) A general description of the ES model(s). For example, banks may describe whether the model(s) is (are) based on historical simulation, Monte 

Carlo simulations or other appropriate analytical methods and the observation period for ES based on stressed observations (ESR,S). 

(d) The frequency by which model data is updated. (e) A description of the ES calculation based on current and stressed observations. For example, banks should describe the reduced set of risk factors used to calibrate the period of stress the share of the variations in the full ES that is explained by the reduced set of risk factors, and the observation period used to identify the most stressful 12 months. 

(C) SES 

(a) A general description of each methodology used to achieve a capital assessment for categories of NMRFs that is consistent with the required 

soundness standard. 

(D) Banks using internal models to determine the DRC must provide the following information: 

(a) A general description of the methodology: Information about the characteristics and scope of the value-at-risk (VaR) and whether different models are used for different exposure classes. For example, banks may describe the range of probability of default (PD) by obligors on the different types of positions, the approaches used to correct market-implied PDs as applicable, the treatment of netting, basis risk between long and short exposures of different obligors, mismatch between a position and its hedge and concentrations that can arise within and across product classes during stressed conditions. 

(b) The methodology used to achieve a capital assessment that is consistent with both the required soundness standard and SMAR13.18 to 

SMAR13.39. 

(E) Validation of models and modelling processes 

(a) The approaches used in the validation of the models and modelling processes, describing general approaches used and the types of assumptions 

and benchmarks on which they rely.

Unconstrained expected shortfall: Expected shortfall (ES) as defined in SMAR13.1 to SMAR13.12, calculated without supervisory constraints on cross-risk factor correlations. Constrained expected shortfall: ES as defined in SMAR13.1 to SMAR13.12, calculated in accordance with SMAR13.14. The constrained ES disclosed should be the sum of partial expected shortfall capital requirements (ie all other risk factors should be held constant) for the range of broad regulatory risk factor classes (interest rate risk, equity risk, foreign exchange risk, commodity risk and credit spread risk). Capital requirement for non-modellable risk factors: aggregate regulatory capital measure calculated in accordance with SMAR13.16 and SMAR13.17, for risk factors in model-eligible trading desks that are deemed non-modellable in accordance with SMAR10.4. Default risk capital (DRC) requirement: in accordance with SMAR13.18, measure of the default risk of trading book positions, except those subject to standardised capital requirements. This covers, inter alia, sovereign exposures (including those denominated in the sovereign's domestic currency), equity positions and defaulted debt positions. Capital surcharge for amber trading desks: capital surcharge for eligible trading desks that is in the P&L attribution test "amber zone", calculated in accordance with SMAR13.45. Subtotal for green and amber trading desks: (CA+DRC) + Capital surcharge, in accordance with SMAR13.41 to SMAR13.43; SMAR13.22; and SMAR13.45. Row 12= max[8/a+9/a; multiplier*8/b+9/b]+max[10/a; 10/b]+11. Total SA capital requirements for trading desks ineligible to use the IMA (CU): standardised approach (SA) capital requirements for trading desks that are either out of scope for model approval or that have been deemed ineligible to use the IMA, corresponding to the total capital requirement under the SA as reported in row 12 of Template MR1. Difference in capital requirements under the IMA and SA for green and amber trading desks: capital requirements for green and amber trading desks under the IMA (IMAG,A) - capital requirements for green and amber trading desks under SA (SAG,A) in accordance with SMAR13.45). SA capital requirement for all trading desks (including those subject to the IMA): the most recent standardised approach capital requirement for all instruments across all trading desks, regardless of whether those trading desks are eligible for the IMA, as set out in SMAR13.43 and SMAR3.10(1).

Template OR1: Historical losses Purpose: To disclose aggregate operational losses incurred over the past 10 years, based on the accounting date of the incurred losses. This disclosure 

informs the operational risk capital calculation. The general principle on retrospective disclosure set out in section 8.2 does not apply for this template. 

From the implementation date of the template onwards, disclosure of all prior periods is required, unless firms have been permitted by SAMA to use 

fewer years in their capital calculation on a transitional basis. 

Scope of application: The table is mandatory for: (i) all banks that are in the second or third business indicator (BI) bucket, regardless of whether 

SAMA has exercised the national discretion to set the internal loss multiplier (ILM) equal to one; and (ii) all banks in the first BI bucket which have 

received SAMA approval to include internal loss data to calculate their operational risk capital requirements. 

Content: Qualitative information. 

Frequency: Annual. 

Format: Fixed. 

Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with narrative commentary explaining the rationale in aggregate, for new 

loss exclusions since the previous disclosure. Banks should disclose any other material information, in aggregate, that would help inform users as to 

its historical losses or its recoveries, with the exception of confidential and proprietary information, including information about legal reserves.

management objective and policies 

25.1.2 Template IRRBB1 - Quantitative information on IRRBB 

25.2 Table IRRBBA provides information on a bank's IRRBB risk management objective and policy. Template IRRBB1 provides quantitative IRRBB information, including the impact of interest rate shocks on their change in economic value of equity and net interest income, computed based on a set of prescribed interest rate shock scenarios. 

25.3 Banks must disclose the measured changes in economic value of equity (∆EVE) and changes in net interest income (∆NII) under the prescribed interest rate shock scenarios set out in Basel Framework "Supervisory review process" (Interest rate risk in the banking book). In disclosing Table IRRBBA and Template IRRBB1, banks should use their own internal measurement system (IMS) to calculate the IRRBB exposure values refer to SAMA circular No. 381000040243 date 1438/04/12AH on Interest Rating Risk in The Banking Book (IRRBB). Basel Framework "Supervisory review process" (Interest rate risk in the banking book) provides a standardised framework that banks may adopt as their IMS. In addition to quantitative disclosure, banks should provide sufficient qualitative information and supporting detail to enable the market and wider public to: 

25.3.1 Monitor the sensitivity of the bank's economic value and earnings to 

changes in interest rates; 

25.3.2 Understand the primary assumptions underlying the measurement 

produced by the bank's IMS; and 

25.3.3 Have an insight into the bank's overall IRRBB objective and IRRBB 

management.

25.5 In addition to the required disclosures in Table IRRBBA and Template IRRBB1, banks are encouraged to make voluntary disclosures of information on internal measures of IRRBB that would assist the market in interpreting the mandatory disclosure numbers. 

13 Interest rate-sensitive assets are assets which are not deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital and which exclude (i) fixed assets such as real estate or intangible assets as well as (ii) equity exposures in the banking book. 

14 The discounting factors must be representative of a risk-free zero coupon rate. An example of an acceptable 

yield curve is a secured interest rate swap curve.

A description of how the bank defines IRRBB for purposes of risk control and measurement. 

A description of the bank's overall IRRBB management and mitigation strategies. Examples are: monitoring of economic value of equity (EVE) and net interest income (NII) in relation to established limits, hedging practices, conduct of stress testing, outcome analysis, the role of independent audit, the role and practices of the asset and liability management committee, the bank's practices to ensure appropriate model validation, and timely updates in response to changing market conditions. The periodicity of the calculation of the bank's IRRBB measures, and a description of the specific measures that the bank uses to gauge its sensitivity to IRRBB. 

A description of the interest rate shock and stress scenarios that the bank uses to estimate changes in the economic value and in earnings. 

Where significant modelling assumptions used in the bank's internal measurement systems (IMS) (ie the EVE metric generated by the bank for purposes other than disclosure, eg for internal assessment of capital adequacy) are different from the modelling assumptions prescribed for the disclosure in Template IRRBB1, the bank should provide a description of those assumptions and their directional implications and explain its rationale for making those assumptions (eg historical data, published research, management judgment and analysis). A high-level description of how the bank hedges its IRRBB, as well as the associated accounting treatment. A high-level description of key modelling and parametric assumptions used in calculating ∆EVE and ∆NII in Template IRRBB1, which includes: 

 

For ∆EVE, whether commercial margins and other spread components have been included in the cash flows used in the computation and discount rate used. 

 How the average repricing maturity of non-maturity deposits has been determined (including any unique product characteristics that 

 

affect assessment of repricing behaviour). The methodology used to estimate the prepayment rates of customer loans, and/or the early withdrawal rates for time deposits, and other significant assumptions. 

 Any other assumptions (including for instruments with behavioural optionalities that have been excluded) that have a material 

impact on the disclosed ∆EVE and ∆NII in Template IRRBB1, including an explanation of why these are material.  Any methods of aggregation across currencies and any significant interest rate correlations between different currencies.

Template GSIB1 - Disclosure of G-SIB indicators Purpose: Provide an overview of the indicators that feed into the Committee's methodology for assessing the systemic importance of global banks. 

Scope of application: The template is mandatory for banks which in the previous year have either been classified as G-SIBs, have a leverage ratio 

exposure measure exceeding EUR 200 billion or were included in the assessment sample by supervisory judgment (see Basel Framework "Scope and 

definitions" Global systemically important Banks). 

For G-SIB assessment purposes, the applicable leverage ratio exposure measure definition is contained in the SLEV. 

For application of this threshold, banks should use the applicable exchange rate information provided on the Basel Committee website 

at www.bis.org/bcbs/gsib/ . The disclosure itself is made in the bank's own currency. 

Content: At least the 12 indicators used in the assessment methodology of the G-SIB framework (see Basel Framework "Scope and definitions" Global 

systemically important Banks). 

Frequency: Annual. 

Format: Flexible. 

Accompanying narrative: Banks should indicate the annual reference date of the information reported as well as the date of first public disclosure. 

Banks should include a web link to the disclosure of the previous G-SIB assessment exercise. 

Banks may supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any relevant qualitative characteristic deemed necessary for understanding 

the quantitative data. This information may include explanations about the use of estimates with a short explanation as regards the method used, mergers 

or modifications of the legal structure of the entity subjected to the reported data, the bucket to which the bank was allocated and changes in higher 

loss absorbency requirements, or reference to the Basel Committee website for data on denominators, cutoff scores and buckets. 

Regardless of whether Template GSIB1 is included in the annual Pillar 3 report, a bank's annual Pillar 3 report as well as all the interim Pillar 3 reports 

should include a reference to the website where current and previous disclosures of Template GSIB1 can be found.

Template CCyB1 - Geographical distribution of credit exposures used in the calculation of the bank-specific countercyclical capital buffer requirement Purpose: Provide an overview of the geographical distribution of private sector credit exposures relevant for the calculation of the bank's countercyclical 

capital buffer. 

Scope of application: The template is mandatory for all banks subject to a countercyclical capital buffer requirement based on the jurisdictions in which 

they have private sector credit exposures subject to a countercyclical capital buffer requirement compliant with the Basel standards. Only banks with 

exposures to jurisdictions in which the countercyclical capital buffer rate is higher than zero should disclose this template. 

Content: Private sector credit exposures and other relevant inputs necessary for the computation of the bank-specific countercyclical capital buffer rate. 

Frequency: Semiannual. 

Format: Flexible. Columns and rows might be added or removed to fit with the domestic implementation of the countercyclical capital buffer and thereby 

provide information on any variables necessary for its computation. A column or a row may be removed if the information is not relevant to the domestic 

implementation of the countercyclical capital buffer framework. 

Accompanying narrative: For the purposes of the countercyclical capital buffer, banks should use, where possible, exposures on an "ultimate risk" basis. 

They should disclose the methodology of geographical allocation used, and explain the jurisdictions or types of exposures for which the ultimate risk 

method is not used as a basis for allocation. The allocation of exposures to jurisdictions should be made taking into consideration the clarifications provided 

by Basel Framework "Risk-based capital requirements" (Buffers above the regulatory minimum). Information about the drivers for changes in the exposure 

amounts and the applicable jurisdiction-specific rates should be summarised.

Definitions and instructions 

Unless otherwise provided for in the domestic implementation of the countercyclical capital buffer framework, private sector credit exposures relevant for the calculation of the countercyclical capital buffer (relevant private sector credit exposures) refer to exposures to private sector counterparties which attract a credit risk capital charge in the banking book, and the risk-weighted equivalent trading book capital charges for specific risk, the incremental risk charge and securitisation. Interbank exposures and exposures to the public sector are excluded, but non-bank financial sector exposures are included. 

Country: Country in which the bank has relevant private sector credit exposures, and which has set a countercyclical capital buffer rate greater than zero that was applicable during the reporting period covered by the template. 

Sum: Sum of private sector credit exposures or RWA for private sector credit exposures, respectively, in jurisdictions with a non-zero countercyclical capital buffer rate.

Total: Total of private sector credit exposures or RWA for private sector credit exposures, respectively, across all jurisdictions to which the bank is exposed, including jurisdictions with no countercyclical capital buffer rate or with a countercyclical capital buffer rate set at zero, and value of the bank-specific countercyclical capital buffer rate and resulting countercyclical capital buffer amount. 

Countercyclical capital buffer rate: Countercyclical capital buffer rate set by SAMA in question and in force during the period covered by the template or, where applicable, the higher countercyclical capital buffer rate set for the country in question by SAMA. Countercyclical capital buffer rates that were set by SAMA, but are not yet applicable in the country in question at the disclosure reference date (pre-announced rates) must not be reported. 

Total exposure value: If applicable, total private sector credit exposures across all jurisdictions to which the bank is exposed, including jurisdictions with no countercyclical capital buffer rate or with a countercyclical capital buffer rate set at zero. 

Total RWA: If applicable, total value of RWA for relevant private sector credit exposures, across all jurisdictions to which the bank is exposed, including jurisdictions with no countercyclical capital buffer rate or with a countercyclical capital buffer rate set at zero. 

Bank-specific countercyclical capital buffer rate: Countercyclical capital buffer that varies between zero and 2.5% or, where appropriate, above 2.5% of total RWA calculated in accordance with SACAP9.2 (B) and (C) as a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer rates that are being applied in jurisdictions where the relevant credit exposures of the bank are located and reported in rows 1 to N. This figure (ie the bank-specific countercyclical capital buffer rate) may not be deduced from the figures reported in this template as private sector credit exposures in jurisdictions that do not have a countercyclical capital buffer rate, which form part of the equation for calculating the figure, are not required to be reported in this template. 

Countercyclical capital buffer amount: Amount of Common Equity Tier 1 capital held to meet the countercyclical capital buffer requirement determined in accordance with SACAP9.2 (B) and (C).

Template LR1- Summary comparison of accounting assets vs leverage ratio exposure measure Purpose: To reconcile the total assets in the published financial statements with the leverage ratio exposure measure. 

Scope of application: The table is mandatory for all banks. 

Content: Quantitative information. The leverage ratio standard of the Basel framework (SLEV) follows the same scope of regulatory consolidation as 

used for the risk-based capital requirements standard Basel Framework "Risk-based capital requirements"). Disclosures should be reported on a quarter-end basis. However, banks may, subject to approval from or due to requirements specified by SAMA, use more frequent calculations (eg daily or 

monthly averaging). Banks are required to include the basis for their disclosures (eg quarter-end, daily averaging or monthly averaging, or a 

combination thereof). 

Frequency: Quarterly. 

Format: Fixed. 

Accompanying narrative: Banks are required to disclose and detail the source of material differences between their total balance sheet assets, as 

reported in their financial statements, and their leverage ratio exposure measure.

The bank's total consolidated assets as per published financial statements. Where a banking, financial, insurance or commercial entity is outside the regulatory scope of consolidation, only the amount of the investment in the capital of that entity (ie only the carrying value of the investment, as opposed to the underlying assets and other exposures of the investee) shall be included in the leverage ratio exposure measure. However, investments in those entities that are deducted from the bank's CET1 capital or from Additional Tier 1 capital in accordance with SACAP4.3 to SACAP4.4 may also be deducted from the leverage ratio exposure measure. As these adjustments reduce the total leverage ratio exposure measure, they shall be reported as a negative amount. This row shows the reduction of the leverage ratio exposure measure due to the exclusion of securitised exposures that meet the operational requirements for the recognition of risk transference according SCRE18.24. As these adjustments reduce the total leverage ratio exposure measure, they shall be reported as a negative amount.

Adjustments related to the temporary exclusion of central bank reserves from the leverage ratio exposure measure, if enacted by SAMA to facilitate the implementation of monetary policies as per SLEV6.6. As these adjustments reduce the total leverage ratio exposure measure, they shall be reported as a negative amount. This row shows the reduction of the consolidated assets for fiduciary assets that are recognised on the bank's balance sheet pursuant to the operative accounting framework and which meet the de-recognition criteria of IAS 39 / IFRS 9 or the IFRS 10 de-consolidation criteria. As these adjustments reduce the total leverage ratio exposure measure, they shall be reported as a negative amount. Adjustments for regular-way purchases and sales of financial assets subject to trade date accounting. The adjustment reflects (i) the reverse-out of any offsetting between cash receivables for unsettled sales and cash payables for unsettled purchases of financial assets that may be recognised under the applicable accounting framework, and (ii) the offset between those cash receivables and cash payables that are eligible per the criteria specified in SLEV7.1.4 (i), (ii). If this adjustment leads to an increase in exposure, it shall be reported as a positive amount. If this adjustment leads to a decrease in exposure, it shall be reported as a negative amount. Adjustments for eligible cash-pooling transactions. The adjustment is the difference between the accounting value of cash-pooling transactions and the treatments specified in SLEV7.1.5. If this adjustment leads to an increase in exposure, it shall be reported as a positive amount. If this adjustment leads to a decrease in exposure, it shall be reported as a negative amount. Adjustments related to derivative financial instruments. The adjustment is the difference between the accounting value of the derivatives recognised as assets and the leverage ratio exposure value as determined by application of SLEV7.2.1 to SLEV7.2.2 ((i) to (v)) and SLEV7.2.3 to SLEV7.2.15. If this adjustment leads to an increase in exposure, institutions shall disclose this as a positive amount. If this adjustment leads to a decrease in exposure, institutions shall disclose this as a negative amount. Adjustments related to Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs) (ie repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending). The adjustment is the difference between the accounting value of the SFTs recognised as assets and the leverage ratio exposure value as determined by application of SLEV7.3.1, SLEV7.3.3 and SLEV7.3.4 to SLEV7.3.5. If this adjustment leads to an increase in the exposure, institutions shall disclose this as a positive amount. If this adjustment leads to a decrease in exposure, institutions shall disclose this as a negative amount. The credit equivalent amount of off-balance sheet items determined by applying the relevant credit conversion factors to the nominal value of the off-balance sheet item, as specified in SLEV7.4.2. (iii), (iv), and SLEV7.4.3 (x) As these amounts increase the total leverage ratio exposure measure, they shall be reported as a positive amount. Adjustments for prudent valuation adjustments and specific and general provisions that have reduced Tier 1 capital. This adjustment reduces the leverage ratio exposure measure by the amount of prudent valuation adjustments and by the amount of specific and general provisions that have reduced Tier 1 capital as determined by SLEV6.2 and SLEV7.1.2 and SLEV7.4.2 (iv), respectively. This adjustment shall be reported as a negative amount. Any other adjustments. If these adjustments lead to an increase in the exposure, institutions shall report this as a positive amount. If these adjustments lead to a decrease in exposure, the institutions shall disclose this as a negative amount.

Template LIQ1: Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) Purpose: Present the breakdown of a bank's cash outflows and cash inflows, as well as its available high-quality liquid assets (HQLA), as measured and defined according to the LCR standard. 

Scope of application: The template is mandatory for all banks. 

Content: Data must be presented as simple averages of daily observations over the previous quarter (ie the average calculated over a period of, typically, 90 days) in the local currency. 

Frequency: Quarterly. 

Format: Fixed. 

Accompanying narrative: Banks must publish the number of data points used in calculating the average figures in the template. In addition, a bank should provide sufficient qualitative discussion to facilitate users' understanding of its LCR calculation. For example, where significant to the LCR, banks could discuss: 

      

the main drivers of their LCR results and the evolution of the contribution of inputs to the LCR's calculation over time; intra-period changes as well as changes over time; the composition of HQLA; concentration of funding sources; currency mismatch in the LCR; and other inflows and outflows in the LCR calculation that are not captured in the LCR common template but which the institution considers to be relevant for its liquidity profile.

General explanations Figures entered in the template must be averages of the observations of individual line items over the financial reporting period (ie the average of components and the average LCR over the most recent three months of daily positions, irrespective of the financial reporting schedule). The averages are calculated after the application of any haircuts, inflow and outflow rates and caps, where applicable. For example: 

where T equals the number of observations in period Qi. Weighted figures of HQLA (row 1, third column) must be calculated after the application of the respective haircuts but before the application of any caps on Level 2B and Level 2 assets. Unweighted inflows and outflows (rows 2-8, 11-15 and 17-20, second column) must be calculated as outstanding balances. Weighted inflows and outflows (rows 2-20, third column) must be calculated after the application of the inflow and outflow rates. Adjusted figures of HQLA (row 21, third column) must be calculated after the application of both (i) haircuts and (ii) any applicable caps (ie cap on Level 2B and Level 2 assets). Adjusted figures of net cash outflows (row 22, third column) must be calculated after the application of both (i) inflow and outflow rates and (ii) any applicable cap (ie cap on inflows). The LCR (row 23) must be calculated as the average of observations of the LCR: 

Not all reported figures will sum exactly, particularly in the denominator of the LCR. For example, "total net cash outflows" (row 22) may not be exactly equal to "total cash outflows" minus "total cash inflows" (row 16 minus row 20) if the cap on inflows is binding. Similarly, the disclosed LCR may not be equal to an LCR computed on the basis on the average values of the set of line items disclosed in the template. 

Definitions and instructions: Columns Unweighted values must be calculated as outstanding balances maturing or callable within 30 days (for inflows and outflows). Weighted values must be calculated after the application of respective haircuts (for HQLA) or inflow and outflow rates (for inflows and outflows). Adjusted values must be calculated after the application of both (i) haircuts and inflow and outflow rates and (ii) any applicable caps (ie cap on Level 2B and Level 2 assets for HQLA and cap on inflows). Row number 

Explanation 

Sum of all eligible HQLA, as defined in the standard, before the application of any limits, excluding assets that do not meet the operational requirements, and including, where applicable, assets qualifying under alternative liquidity approaches. Retail deposits and deposits from small business customers are the sum of stable deposits, less stable deposits and any other funding sourced from (i) natural persons and/or (ii) small business customers (as defined by SCRE10.18 and SCRE10.19). 

Stable deposits include deposits placed with a bank by a natural person and unsecured wholesale funding provided by small business customers, defined as "stable" in the standard. 

Less stable deposits include deposits placed with a bank by a natural person and unsecured wholesale funding provided by small business customers, not defined as "stable" in the standard. 

Unsecured wholesale funding is defined as those liabilities and general obligations from customers other than natural persons and small business customers that are not collateralised. Operational deposits include deposits from bank clients with a substantive dependency on the bank where deposits are required for certain activities (ie clearing, custody or cash management activities). Deposits in institutional networks of cooperative banks include deposits of member institutions with the central institution or specialised central service providers. 

Non-operational deposits are all other unsecured wholesale deposits, both insured and uninsured

Additional requirements include other off-balance sheet liabilities or obligations 

Outflows related to derivative exposures and other collateral requirements include expected contractual derivatives cash flows on a net basis. These outflows also include increased liquidity needs related to: downgrade triggers embedded in financing transactions, derivative and other contracts; the potential for valuation changes on posted collateral securing derivatives and other transactions; excess non-segregated collateral held at the bank that could contractually be called at any time; contractually required collateral on transactions for which the counterparty has not yet demanded that the collateral be posted; contracts that allow collateral substitution to non-HQLA assets; and market valuation changes on derivatives or other transactions.

SLCR Attachment#2 row 222 and 223. 

Credit and liquidity facilities include drawdowns on committed (contractually irrevocable) or conditionally revocable credit and liquidity facilities. The currently undrawn portion of these facilities is calculated net of any eligible HQLA if the HQLA have already been posted as collateral to secure the facilities or that are contractually obliged to be posted when the counterparty draws down the facility. 

Other contractual funding obligations include contractual obligations to extend funds within a 30-day period and other contractual cash outflows not previously captured under the standard. 

Other contingent funding obligations, as defined in the standard. 

Total cash outflows: sum of rows 2-15. 

Secured lending includes all maturing reverse repurchase and securities borrowing agreements. 

Inflows from fully performing exposures include both secured and unsecured loans or other payments that are fully performing and contractually due within 30 calendar days from retail and small business customers, other wholesale customers, operational deposits and deposits held at the centralised institution in a cooperative banking network.

29. Worked examples: Interpretation of the effective date - illustration 

29.1 The following table illustrates the application of paragraph section 3.2 by specifying the first applicable fiscal period for disclosure requirements according to their frequency, using as example a bank with a fiscal year coinciding with the calendar year (case 1), a bank with a fiscal year ending in October of the same calendar year (case 2), and a bank with a fiscal year ending in March of the following calendar year (case 3). 

29.1.1 Banks with fiscal year from 1 January to 31 December: 

a. The first fiscal quarter subject to quarterly disclosure requirements with an "effective as of" date of 1 January of a given year will be the first fiscal quarter, ending in 31 March of that calendar year. The first fiscal quarter subject to quarterly disclosure requirements with an "effective as of" date of 31 December of a given year will be the fourth fiscal quarter, ending in 31 December of that calendar year. 

b. The first fiscal semester subject to semi-annual disclosure requirements with an "effective as of" date of 1 January of a given year will be the first fiscal semester, ending in 31 June of that calendar year. The first fiscal semester subject to semiannual disclosure requirements with an "effective as of" date of 31 December of a given year will be the second fiscal semester, ending in 31 December of that calendar year. 

c. The first fiscal year subject to annual disclosure requirements with an "effective as of" date of 1 January of a given year will be the fiscal year starting in 1 January of that calendar year. The first fiscal year subject to annual disclosure requirements with an "effective as of" date of 31 December of a given year will be the fiscal year ending in that same 31 December of that calendar year. 

29.1.2 Banks with fiscal year from 1 November of the previous calendar 

year to 31 October: 

a. The first fiscal quarter subject to quarterly disclosure requirements with an "effective as of" date of 1 January of a given year will be the first fiscal quarter, ending in 31 January of that calendar year. The first fiscal quarter subject to quarterly disclosure requirements with an "effective

The first fiscal semester subject to semiannual disclosure requirements with an "effective as of" date of 31 December of a given year will be the first fiscal semester, ending in 31 April of the following calendar year. c. The first fiscal year subject to annual disclosure requirements with an "effective as of" date of 1 January of a given year will be the fiscal year starting in 1 November of the previous calendar year. The first fiscal year subject to annual disclosure requirements with an "effective as of" date of 31 December of a given year will be the fiscal year ending in 31 October of the following calendar year. 

29.1.3 Banks with fiscal year from 1 April to 31 March of the next calendar 

year: 

a. The first fiscal quarter subject to quarterly disclosure requirements with an "effective as of" date of 1 January of a given year will be the fourth fiscal quarter, ending in 31 March of that calendar year. The first fiscal quarter subject to quarterly disclosure requirements with an "effective as of" date of 31 December of a given year will be the third fiscal quarter, ending in 31 December of that calendar year. 

b. The first fiscal semester subject to semiannual disclosure requirements with an "effective as of" date of 1 January of a given year will be the second fiscal semester, ending in 31 March of that calendar year. The first fiscal semester subject to semiannual disclosure requirements with an "effective as of" date of 31 December of a given year will be the second fiscal semester, ending in 31 March of the following calendar year. 

c. The first fiscal year subject to annual disclosure requirements with an "effective as of" date of 1 January of a given year will be the fiscal year starting in 1 April of the previous calendar year. The first fiscal year subject to annual disclosure requirements with an "effective as of" date of 31 December of a given year will be the fiscal year ending in 31 March of the following calendar year.

Exposures secured by collateral: carrying amount of exposures (net of allowances/impairments) partly or totally secured by collateral. In case an exposure is secured by collateral and other credit risk mitigation mechanism(s), the carrying amount of the exposures secured by collateral is the remaining share of the exposure secured by collateral after consideration of the shares of the exposure already secured by other mitigation mechanisms expected to be called beforehand in the event of a loss, without considering overcollateralisation. Exposures secured by financial guarantees: carrying amount of exposures (net of allowances/impairments) partly or totally secured by financial guarantees. In case an exposure is secured by financial guarantees and other credit risk mitigation mechanism, the carrying amount of the exposure secured by financial guarantees is the remaining share of the exposure secured by financial guarantees after consideration of the shares of the exposure already secured by other mitigation mechanisms expected to be called beforehand in the event of a loss, without considering overcollateralisation. Exposures secured by credit derivatives: carrying amount of exposures (net of allowances/impairments) partly or totally secured by credit derivatives. In case an exposure is secured by credit derivatives and other credit risk mitigation mechanism(s), the carrying amount of the exposure secured by credit derivatives is the remaining share of the exposure secured by credit derivatives after consideration of the shares of the exposure already secured by other mitigation mechanisms expected to be called beforehand in the event of a loss, without considering overcollateralisation.

29.4.1 The aggregate capital requirement for approved and eligible trading desks (TDs) (IMAG,A) according to SMAR13.43 is defined as: CA + DRC + Capital surcharge. 

29.4.2 According to SMAR13.41 CA is defined as: 

29.4.3 According to SMAR13.22 DRC is defined as the greater of: (1) the average of the DRC requirement model measures over the previous 12 weeks; or (2) the most recent DRC requirement model measure. 

29.4.4 According to SMAR13.45 Capital surcharge: is calculated as the difference between the aggregated standardised capital charges (SAG,A) and the aggregated internal models-based capital charges (IMA G,A = CA + DRC) multiplied by a factor k. k and SAG,A are only recent while IMAG,A is average or recent -> Surcharge is average or recent. 

Example: illustration of the correct specification for row 12 in template MR2 

29.5 Applying the formulae set out in SMAR13.22, SMAR13.41, SMAR13.43, and SMAR13.45 (marked in blue below), the relevant components for CA [either most recent (8+9) or average 1.5*8 +9] and DRC should take the respectively greater value of the "most recent" and "average" (marked in red). This results in the green and amber trading desks total capital requirements (including capital surcharge) of 485.

Article # 

Question 

Answer 

Overview of risk management, key prudential metrics and RWA 

default 

For counterparty credit risk (CCR) (rows 6-9), the split requested is by the exposure (EAD) at methodology classification used to determine exposure levels rather than the risk-weighted (RWA) asset methodology classification used risk to determine weights. This contradicts the presentation for credit risk and securitisation (rows 16-19). Should line items be added (where to reconcile the disclosure to the total RWA? 

necessary) 

(rows 

1-5) 

Template OV1 does not request CCR to be split by risk weighting methodology, but by EAD methodology. Nevertheless, banks should add extra rows, as appropriate, to split the exposures by risk weighting methodology*, in order to facilitate the reconciliation with the RWA changes in Template CCR7. 

* RWA and capital requirements under the Standardised Approach for credit risk weighting are to be subdivided in the standardised approach for counterparty credit risk (SA-CCR) and the internal models method (IMM), and the same for RWA and capital requirements under the internal ratings-based (IRB) approach for credit risk weighting.

for the amount that is actually deducted from capital. Some examples are shown below: - Goodwill and intangible assets: the amount to be disclosed in column (g) is the amount of any goodwill or intangibles,* including any goodwill included in the valuation of significant investments in the capital of banking, financial and insurance entities that are outside the scope of regulatory consolidation. The amount disclosed in the assets rows is net of any associated deferred tax liability which would be extinguished if the intangible assets become impaired or derecognised under the relevant accounting standards. The associated deferred tax liability is also to be disclosed in the liabilities rows of column (g). - Deferred tax assets: for all types of deferred tax assets to be deducted from own funds, the amount to be disclosed in column (g) is net of associated deferred tax liabilities that are eligible for netting. The associated deferred tax liabilities are to be disclosed in the liabilities rows of column (g). For deferred tax assets, for which the deduction is subject to a threshold, the amount disclosed in column (g) in the assets rows is the amount, net of any eligible deferred tax liability, above the threshold. The associated deferred tax liabilities are also to be disclosed in the liabilities rows of column (g). - Defined benefit pension fund assets: the amount disclosed is net of any deferred tax liabilities which would be extinguished if the asset should become impaired or derecognised under the relevant accounting standards. These deferred tax liabilities are also to be disclosed in the liabilities rows of column (g). - Investments in own shares (treasury stock) or own instruments of regulatory capital: when investments in own shares or own instruments of regulatory capital are not already derecognised under the relevant accounting standards, the deducted amount disclosed is net of short positions in the same underlying exposure or in the same underlying index allowed to be netted under the Basel framework. These short positions are also to be disclosed in the liabilities rows of column (g). * Under SACAP4.1.1, subject to SAMA approval, IFRS definition of intangible assets to determine which assets are classified as intangible and are thus required to be deducted.

the 

1,250% risk-weighted exposures should be disclosed in the relevant credit risk or securitisation risk templates. 

The liabilities disclosed in column (g) are all liabilities under the regulatory scope of consolidation, except for the following, which are disclosed in columns (c), (d), (e) and (f) as applicable: liabilities that are included in the determination of the exposure values in the market risk or the counterparty credit risk framework; and liabilities that are eligible under the Basel netting rules. 

What is the difference in Template LI2 between the required disclosure in row 2 (Liabilities carrying value regulatory amount under scope of consolidation) and row 6 (Differences due to different netting rules, other than those already included in row 2). 

Row 2 refers to balance sheet netting, while row 6 refers to incremental netting in application of the Basel rules (when not already covered by balance sheet netting). The netting rules under the Basel framework are different from the rules under the applicable accounting frameworks. The incremental netting in row 6 could represent an additional deduction from the net exposure value before application of the Basel netting rules (when those rules lead to more netting than the balance sheet netting in row 2) or a gross-up of the net exposure value when the off-balance sheet netting operated in row 2 is broader than what the Basel netting rules allow. 

How does the disclosure in Template LI2, in particular row 3 (total net amount under regulatory scope of consolidated) to accounting equity? 

relate 

The netting between assets and liabilities in Template LI2 does not lead to accounting equity under a regulatory scope of consolidation being disclosed in row 3. Assets and liabilities included in rows 1 and 2 are limited to those assets and liabilities that are taken into consideration in the regulatory framework. Other assets and liabilities not considered in the regulatory framework are to be disclosed in column (g) in Template LI1 and are consequently excluded from rows 1 and 2 of Template LI2. 

For Template LI2, how would the entry in row 10 amounts (exposure

When an exposure benefits from multiple types of credit risk mitigation mechanisms, the exposure value should be allocated to each mechanism by order of priority based on the credit risk mitigation mechanism which banks would apply in the event of loss. Disclosure should be limited to the value of the exposure (ie the amount of overcollateralisation does not need to be disclosed in the table). If the bank wishes to disclose information regarding the over-collateralisation, it may do so in the accompanying narrative. Refer to example in section 28.3.

implementation of the Basel framework allows exposures to CCPs to be included. 

Under the IRB approach, credit derivatives are recognised as CRM techniques for the F-IRB and A-IRB. In both cases, banks can reflect the risk mitigating effect of credit derivatives on an exposure by adjusting their PD or loss-given-default (LGD). Banks should disclose in column (a), the RWA of an exposure secured by a credit derivative calculated without reflecting the risk mitigating effect of credit derivatives (in the example, banks would disclose 150 SAR). In column (b), the RWA of the same exposure calculated reflecting the risk mitigating effect of credit derivatives (in the example, banks would disclose 30*50% + 70*150% = 120) should be disclosed.

Should "end of the previous year" include only non-defaulted accounts at the beginning of the year, or both defaulted non-defaulted and accounts? Should "end of 

"Weighted" means exposure at default (EAD)-weighted. For this purpose, the formula in the question is correct since the data will be comparable to those reported in column (i). 

The definition of obligors or retail obligors is the same as for other obligors; any individual person or persons, or a small or medium-sized entity. Furthermore, where banks apply the "transaction approach", each transaction shall be considered as a single obligor. A defaulted obligor is an obligor that meets the conditions set out in SCRE16.67 to SCRE16.74. 

For column (f), the "end of the previous year" includes non-defaulted accounts at the beginning of the year of reference for disclosure. The "end of the year" includes all the non-defaulted accounts related to obligors already included in the "end of the previous year" plus all the new obligors acquired during the year of reference for disclosure which did not go into default during the

What considerations can institutions reference when model disclosing performance test (backtesting) when the test is not aligned to the year-end disclosure timetable? 

year. Banks have discretion as to whether to include obligors who left during the year within the "end of the year" number. 

For column (g), "defaulted obligors" includes: (i) obligors not in default at the beginning of the year who went into default during the year; and (ii) new obligors acquired during the year- through origination or purchase of loans, debt securities or off-balance sheet commitments - that were not in default, but which went into default during the year. Obligors under (ii) are also separately disclosed in column (h). The PD or PD range to be included in columns (d) and (e) is the one assigned at the beginning of the period for obligors that are not in default at the beginning of the period. 

The frequency of the disclosure is not linked to the timing of the bank's backtesting. The annual disclosure frequency does not require a timetable of model backtesting that is calibrated on a calendar year basis. When the backtesting reference period is not calibrated on a calendar year basis, but on another time interval (for instance, a 12- month interval), "year" as used in columns (f), (g) and (h) of Template CR9 means "over the period used for the backtesting of a model". Banks must, however, disclose the time horizon (observation period /timetable) they use for their backtesting. 

Counterparty credit risk 

The numbers reported in Template CCR5 should be the total collateral posted/received (ie not limited to the collateral that is applied/used for risk mitigation). The purpose of the template is to provide a view on the collateral posted/received rather than the value accounted for within the regulatory computation. If the bank wishes to disclose the collateral eligible for credit mitigation, it may do so using an accompanying narrative. 

20 

The "purpose" of Template CCR5 asks for a breakdown of all types of collateral posted or received. The content section, however, asks for collateral used. These numbers differ as are certain over-collateralised (ie >100% of exposure) and therefore not all collateral would be used for risk the mitigation. all template

Template CCR7 is consistent with Template OV1, which requests a split by exposure at default (EAD) methodology and not by risk weighting methodology. Banks are recommended to add rows to report any changes relating to risk weighting methodology if they deem them useful. The row breakdown is flexible and intends to depict all the significant drivers of changes for the risk-weighted assets (RWA) under counterparty credit risk. Specific rows should be inserted when changes to the IRB model result in changes to the RWA of instruments under counterparty credit risk whose exposure value is determined based on the IMM. 

Template CCR7 refers to an internal RWA flow on models method (IMM) exposures. Row 4 (Model updates - IMM only) and row 5 (Methodology and policy - IMM only) are specifically to include only model and methodology/policy changes relating to the IMM exposures model. Where in the template would changes to the internal-ratings based (IRB) models that result in changes in risk weights for positions under the IMM be reported? 

Template SEC1 requires the disclosure "carrying of values". Is there a direct link between columns (d), (h) and (l) of Template SEC1 and column (e) of Template LI1? 

21 

Securitisation 

Reconciliation is not possible when Template SEC1 presents securitisation exposures within and outside the securitisation framework together. However, when banks choose to disclose Template SEC1 and SEC2 separately for securitisation exposures within the securitisation framework and outside that framework, the following reconciliation is possible: the sum of on-balance sheet assets and liabilities included in columns (d), (h) and (l) of Template SEC1 is equal to the amounts disclosed in column (e) of Template LI1. 

Should institutions disclose RWA before or after the application of the cap? 

RWA figures disclosed in Templates SEC3 and SEC4 should be before application of the cap, as it is useful for users to compare exposures and risk-weighted assets (RWA) before application of the cap. Columns (a)-(m) in Templates SEC3 and SEC4 should be
