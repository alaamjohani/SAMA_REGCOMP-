Pillar 3 Disclosure Requirements  Framework  
1. Introduction :  
Basel Committee on Banking Supervision issued a doc ument on Basel III: Finalizing 
post-crisis reforms in December 2017. Which includes the revised  disclosure 
requirements  that aims to enhance transparency by setting the minimum requirements 
for market disclosures of information on the risk management pract ices and capital 
adequacy of banks. This will enable market participants to obtain key information on 
risk exposures, risk management framework, adequacy of regulatory capital of banks, 
reduces information asymmetry and helps promote comparability of banks ’ risk 
profiles within and across jurisdictions. In addition, banks’ Pillar 3 disclosure will also 
facilitate supervisory monitoring while strengthening incentives for banks to 
implement robust risk management.  
Among the key revisions to the Pillar 3 frame work include disclosure requirements 
related to:  
a) Credit risk, operational risk, the leverage ratio and credit valuation adjustment 
(CVA) risk;  
b) Risk-weighted assets (RWAs) as calculated by the bank's internal models and 
according to the standardised approac hes; 
c) Disclosures related to the revised market risk framework  
d) Overview of risk management framework, RWAs and key prudential metrics; 
and 
e) Asset encumbrance; and  
f) Capital distribution constraints  
This framework is issued by SAMA in exercise of the authority vested in SAMA under 
the Central Bank Law issued via Royal Decree No. M/36 dated 11/04/1442H, and the 
Banking Control Law issued 01/01/1386H.  
This framework supersedes all circulars/instructions/rules related to Pillar 3 
Disclosure Requirements previously issued by SAMA.

Framework December  2022  2.1  
 
2. Scope of application:  
2.1 Disclosure requirements are an integral part of the Basel framework. Unless 
otherwise stated, the Tables and Templates are applicable to all domestic banks both 
on a consolidated basis, which include all branches a nd subsidiaries, and on a 
standalone basis.  
2.2 This framework is not applicable to Foreign Banks Branches operating in the 
kingdom of Saudi Arabia . 
2.3 Banks must assess the applicability of the disclosure requirements based on their 
specific compliance obligatio ns. 
3. Implementation dates:  
3.1 Disclosure requirements  will be effective on 01 January 2023.  
3.2 Disclosure requirements are applicable for Pillar 3 reports related to fiscal periods 
that include or come after the specific calendar implementation date which mean s 
that the first set of templates/tables will cover data as at March 31, 2023.  
4. Guiding principles of banks’ Pillar 3 disclosures : 
4.1 Banks should ensure compliance with the following guiding principles which  aim to 
provide a firm foundation for achieving t ransparent, high -quality Pillar 3 risk 
disclosures that will enable users to better understand and compare a bank's business 
and its risks : 
Principle 1: Disclosures should be clear  
4.2 Disclosures should be presented in a form that is understandable to key sta keholders 
(eg investors, analysts, financial customers and others) and communicated through 
an accessible medium. Important messages should be highlighted and easy to find. 
Complex issues should be explained in simple language with important terms 
defined.  Related risk information should be presented together.  
Principle 2: Disclosures should be comprehensive  
4.3 Disclosures should describe a bank's main activities and all significant risks, 
supported by relevant underlying data and information. Significant chan ges in risk 
exposures between reporting periods should be described, together with the 
appropriate response by management.  
4.4 Disclosures should provide sufficient information in both qualitative and 
quantitative terms on a bank's processes and procedures for  identifying, measuring 

<<PAGE 6>>
   
 
 
Page Number 
6 of 168 Issue Date Version Number Pillar 3 Disclosure Requirements  
Framework December  2022  2.1  
 
and managing those risks. The level of detail of such disclosure should be 
proportionate to a bank's complexity.  
4.5 Approaches to disclosure should be sufficiently flexible to reflect how senior 
management and the board of directors in ternally assess and manage risks and 
strategy, helping users to better understand a bank's risk tolerance/appetite.  
Principle 3: Disclosures should be meaningful to users  
4.6 Disclosures should highlight a bank's most significant current and emerging risks 
and how those risks are managed, including information that is likely to receive 
market attention. Where meaningful, linkages must be provided to line items on the 
balance sheet or the income statement. Disclosures that do not add value to users' 
understandin g or do not communicate useful information should be avoided. 
Furthermore, information which is no longer meaningful or relevant to users should 
be removed.  
Principle 4: Disclosures should be consistent over time  
4.7 Disclosures should be consistent over time to enable key stakeholders to identify 
trends in a bank's risk profile across all significant aspects of its business. Additions, 
deletions and other important changes in disclosures from previous reports, 
including those arising from a bank's specific, re gulatory or market developments, 
should be highlighted and explained.  
Principle 5: Disclosures should be comparable across banks  
4.8 The level of detail and the format of presentation of disclosures should enable key 
stakeholders to perform meaningful comparis ons of business activities, prudential 
metrics, risks and risk management between banks and across jurisdictions.  
5. Assurance of Pillar 3 data : 
5.1 Banks must establish a formal board -approved disclosure policy for Pillar 3 
information that sets out the inter nal controls and procedures for disclosure of such 
information. The key elements of this policy should be described in the year -end 
Pillar 3 report or cross -referenced to another location where they are available.  
5.2 The board of directors and senior managem ent are responsible for establishing and 
maintaining an effective internal control structure over the disclosure of financial 
information, including Pillar 3 disclosures. They must also ensure that appropriate 
review of the disclosures takes place. The inf ormation provided by banks under 
Pillar 3 must be subject, at a minimum, to the same level of internal review and 
internal control processes as the information provided by banks for thei r financial 

<<PAGE 7>>

7 of 168 Issue Date Version Number Pillar 3 Disclosure Requirements  
Framework December  2022  2.1  
 
reporting (i.e. the level of assurance must be the same as  for information provided 
within the management discussion and analysis part of the financial report).  
5.3 One or more senior officers of a bank  must attest in writing that all Pillar 3 
disclosures have been prepared in accordance with the board -agreed interna l control 
processes.  
6. Reporting location : 
6.1 Banks must publish their Pillar 3 report in a standalone document that provides a 
readily accessible source of prudential measures for users. The Pillar 3 report may 
be appended to, or form a discrete section of,  a bank's financial reporting, but it must 
be easily identifiable to users. Signposting of disclosure requirements is permitted 
in certain circumstances, as set out in section 7.2. Banks must also make available 
on their websites an archive for 10 years  retention period of Pillar 3 reports 
(quarterly, semi -annual and annual) relating to prior reporting periods.  
6.2 Banks are required to submit a copy of the disclosures  to SAMA via the following 
email address: BankingDataSection@SAMA.GOV.SA  
7. Presentation of th e disclosure requirements : 
7.1 Templates and tables:  
7.1.1 The disclosure requirements are presented either in the form of templates or 
tables. Templates must be completed with quantitative data in accordance with 
the definitions provided. Tables generally relate to  qualitative requirements, 
but quantitative information is also required in some instances. Banks may 
choose the format they prefer when presenting the information requested in 
tables.  
7.1.2 In line with Principle 3 in section 4.6, the information provided in th e templates 
and tables should be meaningful to users. The disclosure requirements in this 
document that necessitate an assessment from banks are specifically identified. 
When preparing these individual tables and templates, banks will need to 
consider care fully how widely the disclosure requirement should apply. If a 
bank considers that the information requested in a template  or table would not 
be meaningful to users, for example because the exposures and risk -weighted 
asset (RWA) amounts are deemed immater ial, it may choose not to disclose 
part or all of the information requested. In such circumstances, however, the 
bank will be required to explain in a narrative commentary why it considers 
such information not to be meaningful to users. It should describe the portfolios 

<<PAGE 8>>
   
 
 
Page Number 
8 of 168 Issue Date Version Number Pillar 3 Disclosure Requirements  
Framework December  2022  2.1  
 
excluded from the disclosure requirement and the aggregate total RWA those 
portfolios represent.  
7.1.3 For templates, the format is designated as either fixed or flexible:  
a) Where the format of a template is described as fixed, banks must complete 
the fields in accordance with the instructions given. If a row/column is not 
considered to be relevant to a bank's activities or the required information 
would not be meaningful to users (eg immaterial from a quantitative 
perspective), the bank may delete t he specific row/column from the 
template, but the numbering of the subsequent rows and columns must not 
be altered. Banks may add extra rows and extra columns to fixed format 
templates if they wish to provide additional detail to a disclosure 
requirement b y adding sub -rows or columns, but the numbering of 
prescribed rows and columns in the template must not be altered.  
b) Where the format of a template is described as flexible, banks may present 
the required information either in the format provided in this do cument or in 
one that better suits the bank. The format for the presentation of qualitative 
information in tables is not prescribed. Notwithstanding, banks should 
comply with the restrictions in presentation, should such restrictions be 
prescribed in the t emplate (eg Template CCR5 in section 20 ). In addition, 
when a customised presentation of the information is used, the bank must 
provide information comparable with that required in the disclosure 
requirement (ie at a similar level of granularity as if the template/table were 
completed as presented in this document).  
7.2 Signposting:  
7.2.1 Banks may disclose in a document separate from their Pillar 3 report (eg in a 
bank's annual report or through published regulatory reporting) the 
templates/tables with a flexible fo rmat, and the fixed format templates where 
the criteria in section 7.2.2 are met. In such circumstances, the bank must 
signpost clearly in its Pillar 3 report where the disclosure requirements have 
been published. This signposting in the Pillar 3 report mu st include:  
a) The title and number of the disclosure requirement;  
b) The full name of the separate document  in which the disclosure requirement 
has been published;  
c) A web link, where relevant; and  

<<PAGE 9>>
   
 
 
Page Number 
9 of 168 Issue Date Version Number Pillar 3 Disclosure Requirements  
Framework December  2022  2.1  
 
d) The page and paragraph number of the separate document where the 
disclosure requirements can be located.  
7.2.2 The disclosure requirements for templates with a fixed format may be 
disclosed by banks in a separate document other than the Pillar 3 report, 
provided all of the following criteria are met:  
a) The information contained  in the signposted document is equivalent in terms 
of presentation and content to that required in the fixed template and allows 
users to make meaningful comparison with information provided by banks 
disclosing the fixed format templates;  
b) The information c ontained in the signposted document is based on the same 
scope of consolidation as the one used in the disclosure requirement;  
c) The disclosure in the signposted document is mandatory; and  
d) SAMA is  responsible for ensuring the implementation of the Basel stan dards 
is subject to legal constraints in its ability to require the reporting of 
duplicative information.  
7.2.3 Banks can only make use of signposting to another document if the level of 
assurance on the reliability of data in the separate document are equivalen t to, 
or greater than, the internal assurance level required for the Pillar 3 report (see 
sections on reporting location and assurance above).  
8. Frequency and timing of disclosures : 
8.1 The frequencies of disclosure as indicated in the disclosure templates an d tables vary 
between quarterly, semiannual and annual reporting depending upon the nature of 
the specific disclosure requirement.  Annexure 2  summarizes  the frequency and 
timing of disclosures for each table.  
8.2 A bank's Pillar 3 report must be published conc urrently with its financial 
report for the corresponding period . If a Pillar 3 disclosure is required to be 
published for a period when a bank does not produce any financial report  (eg 
semiannual) , disclosure s must be published as soon as practicable  and the time lag 
must be no  longer than the maximum period of 30 days for quarterly disclosures and 
60 days for semiannually and annually disclosures from  its regular financial 
reporting period -ends.

Framework December  2022  2.1  
 
9. Retrospective disclosures, disclosure of transitional metr ics and reporting periods : 
9.1 In templates which require the disclosure of data points for current and previous 
reporting periods, the disclosure of the data point for the previous period is not 
required when a metric for a new standard is reported for the fi rst time unless this is 
explicitly stated in the disclosure requirement.  
9.2 Unless otherwise specified in the disclosure templates, when a bank is under a 
transitional regime permitted by the standards, the transitional data should be 
reported unless the bank  already complies with the fully loaded requirements. Banks 
should clearly state whether the figures disclosed are computed on a transitional or 
fully -loaded basis. Where applicable, banks under a transitional regime may 
separately disclose fully -loaded fi gures in addition to transitional metrics.  
9.3 Unless otherwise specified in the disclosure templates, the data required for annual, 
semiannual and quarterly disclosures should be for the corresponding 12 -month, six -
month and three -month period, respectively.  
10. Proprietary and confidential information : 
10.1 In exceptional cases, where disclosure of certain items required by Pillar 3 may 
reveal the position of a bank or contravene its legal obligations by making public 
information that is proprietary or confidentia l in nature , a bank does not need to 
disclose those specific items, but must disclose more general information about the 
subject matter of the requirement instead. It must also explain in the narrative 
commentary to the disclosure requirement the fact that  the specific items of 
information have not been disclosed and the reasons for this.  
11. Qualitative narrative to accompany the disclosure requirements : 
11.1 Banks should  supplement the quantitative information provided in both fixed and 
flexible templates with  a narrative commentary to explain at least any significant 
changes between reporting periods and any other issues that management considers 
to be of interest to market participants. The form taken by this additional narrative 
is at the bank's discretion.  
11.2 Additional voluntary risk disclosures allow banks to present information relevant to 
their business model that may not be adequately captured by the standardised 
requirements. Additional quantitative information that banks choose to disclose 
must provide s ufficient meaningful information to enable market participants to 
understand and analyse any figures provided. It must also be accompanied by a 
qualitative discussion. Any additional disclosure must comply with the five guiding 
principles above.

Framework December  2022  2.1  
 
12. Overvi ew of risk management, key prudential metrics and RWA : 
 
12.1 The disclosure requirements under this section are:  
12.1.1  Template KM1 – Key metrics (at consolidated level)  
12.1.2  Template KM2 – Key metrics – total loss -absorbing capacity (TLAC) 
requirements (at resolution gro up level)  
12.1.3  Table OVA – Bank risk management approach  
12.1.4  Template OV1 – Overview of risk -weighted assets (RWA)  
12.2 The disclosure requirements related to TLAC are not required to be completed 
by banks unless otherwise specified by SAMA.  
12.3 Template KM1 provides users of Pillar 3 data with a time series set of key prudential 
metrics covering a bank’s available capital (including buffer requirements and 
ratios), its RWA, leverage ratio, Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) and Net Stable 
Funding Ratio (NSFR). As set out in  circular No.391000029731 dated 15/03/1439 
AH, banks are required to publicly disclose whether they are applying a transitional 
arrangement for the impact of expected credit loss accounting on regulatory capital. 
If a transitional arrangement is applied, Templ ate KM1 will provide users with 
information on the impact on the bank’s regulatory capital and leverage ratios 
compared to the bank’s “fully loaded” capital and leverage ratios had the transitional 
arrangement not been applied.  
12.4 Template KM2 requires global  systemically important banks (G -SIBs) to disclose 
key metrics on TLAC. Template KM2 becomes effective from the TLAC 
conformance date.  
12.5 Table OVA provides information on a bank’s strategy and how senior management 
and the board of directors assess and manag e risks.  
12.6 Template OV1 provides an overview of total RWA forming the denominator of the 
risk-based capital requirements.

Template KM1: Key metrics (at consolidated group level)  
Purpose:  To provide an overview of a bank’s prudential regulatory metrics.  
Scope of application : The template is mandatory for all banks.  
Content:  Key prudential metrics related to risk -based capital ratios, leverage ratio and liquidity standards. Banks are required to disclose each metric’s 
value using the corresponding standard’ s specifications for the reporting period -end (designated by T in the template below) as well as the four previous 
quarter -end figures (T –1 to T –4). All metrics are intended to reflect actual bank values for (T), with the exception of “fully loaded expecte d credit 
losses (ECL)” metrics, the leverage ratio (excluding the impact of any applicable temporary exemption of central bank reserve s) and metrics designated 
as “pre -floor” which may not reflect actual values . 
Frequency:  Quarterly . 
Format:  Fixed . If banks wish to add rows to provide additional regulatory or financial metrics, they must provide definitions for these metrics a nd a 
full explanation of how the metrics are calculated (including the scope of consolidation and the regulatory capital used if r elevant). The additional 
metrics must not replace the metrics in this disclosure requirement.  
Accompanying narrative : Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant change in each 
metric’s value compare d with previous quarters, including the key drivers of such changes (eg whether the changes are due to changes in the regulat ory 
framework, group structure or business model).  
Banks that apply transitional arrangement for ECL are expected to supplement th e template with the key elements of the transition they use.

floor.  
5a, 6a, 
7a, 14a  For fully loaded ECL ratios (%) in rows 5a, 6a, 7a and 14a, the denominator (RWA, Basel III leverage ratio exposure measure) is also 
“Fully loaded ECL”, ie as if ECL transitional arrangements were not ap plied.  
5b, 6b, 
7b For pre -floor risk based ratios in rows 5b, 6b and 7b, the disclosed ratios should exclude the impact of the capital floor in the cal culation 
of RWA.  
12 CET1 available after meeting the bank’s minimum capital requirements (as a percenta ge of RWA): it may not necessarily be the difference 
between row 5 and the Basel III minimum CET1 requirement of 4.5% because CET1 capital may be used to meet the bank’s Tier 1 a nd/or 
total capital ratio requirements. See instructions to [CC1:68/a].  
13 Total Basel III leverage ratio exposure measure: The amounts may reflect period -end values or averages depending on local 
implementation.

Table OVA: Bank risk management approach  
Purpose:  Description of the bank's strategy and how senior management and the board of directors assess and manage risks, enabling use rs to gain a clear 
understa nding of the bank's risk tolerance/appetite in relation to its main activities and all significant risks.  
Scope of application:  The template is mandatory for all banks.  
Content:  Qualitative information.  
Frequency:  Annual  
Format:  Flexible  
Banks must de scribe their risk management objectives and policies, in particular:  
(a) How the business model determines and interacts with the overall risk profile (eg the key risks related to the business model  and how each of these risks 
is reflected and described i n the risk disclosures) and how the risk profile of the bank interacts with the risk tolerance approved by the board.    
(b) The risk governance structure: responsibilities attributed throughout the bank (eg oversight and delegation of authority; bre akdown  of responsibilities 
by type of risk, business unit etc); relationships between the structures involved in risk management processes (eg board of directors, executive 
management, separate risk committee, risk management structure, compliance function, inte rnal audit function).    
(c) Channels to communicate, decline and enforce the risk culture within the bank (eg code of conduct; manuals containing operati ng limits or procedures 
to treat violations or breaches of risk thresholds; procedures to raise and sh are risk issues between business lines and risk functions).    
(d) The scope and main features of risk measurement systems.    
(e) Description of the process of risk information reporting provided to the board and senior management, in particular the scope  and main content of 
reporting on risk exposure.    
(f) Qualitative information on stress testing (eg portfolios subject to stress testing, scenarios adopted and methodologies used,  and use of stress testing in 
risk management).    
(g) The strategies and p rocesses to manage, hedge and mitigate risks that arise from the bank's business model and the processes for monitoring the 
continuing effectiveness of hedges and mitigants.

book. The RWA amounts must be derived from the capital requirements (which include the impact of the cap in accordance with  SCRE18. 50 to 
SCRE18. 55, and do not systematically correspond to the RWA reported in Templates SEC3 and SEC4, which are before application of the cap) . 
20 Market risk:  the amounts reported in row 20 correspond to the RWA and capital requireme nts in the market risk standard ( MAR ), with the 
exception of amounts that relate to CVA risk (as specified in  SCCR11  and reported in row 10). They also include capital charges for securitisation 
positions booked in the trading book but exclude the counterparty credit risk capital charges (reported in row 6 of this temp late). The RWA f or

23 Capital charge for switch between trading book and banking book: outstanding accumulated capital surcharge imposed on the ban k in accordanc e 
with Basel Framework “Risk -based capital requirements ” (Boundary between the banking book and trading book ) 25.14 and 25.15 , when the total 
capital charge (across banking book and trading book) of a bank is reduced as a re sult of the instruments being switched between the trading book 
and the banking book at the bank's discretion and after their original designation. The outstanding accumulated capital surch arge takes into account 
any adjustment due to run -off as the positi ons mature or expire, in a manner agreed with SAMA .

according to  SACAP4.4.  They include significant investments in the capital of banking, finan cial and insurance entities that are outside the scope 
of regulatory consolidation and below the threshold for deduction, after application of the 250% risk weight.  
26 Output floor applied:  the output floor (expressed as a percentage) applied by the bank in its computation of the floor adjustment value in rows 27 
and 28.  
27 Floor adjustment (before the application of transitional cap):  the impact of the output floor before the application of the transitional cap, based on 
the output floor applied in row 2 6, in terms of the increase in RWA.  
28 Floor adjustment (after the application of transitional cap):  the impact of the output floor after the application of the transitional cap, based on the 
output floor applied in row 26, in terms of the increase in RWA . The figure disclosed in this row takes into account the transitional cap (if any) 
applied by SAMA , which will limit the increase in RWA to 25% of the bank's RWA before the application of the output floor.

13. Comparison of modelled and standardised RWA : 
13.1 This chapter covers disclosures  on RWA calculated according to the full 
standardised approach as compared to the actual RWA at the risk level, and for credit 
risk at asset class and sub -asset class levels.  The disclosure requirements related 
in this section are not required to be comple ted by banks unless SAMA approve 
the bank to use the IRB and/ or IMA approach.

level  
13.2.2 Template CMS2 – Comparison of modelled and standardi sed RWA for 
credit risk at asset class level  
13.3 Template CMS1 provides the disclosure of RWA calculated according to the full 
standardised approach as compared to actual RWA at risk level. Template CMS2 
further elaborates on the comparison between RWA compute d under the 
standardised and the internally modelled approaches by focusing on RWA for credit 
risk at asset class and sub -asset class levels.

Template CMS1 – Comparison of modelled and standardised RWA at risk level  
Purpose:  To compare full standardised risk-weighted assets (RWA) against modelled RWA for banks  which  have received  SAMA ’s approval to use  
internal models  in accordance with the Basel framework. The disclosure also provides the full standardised RWA amount that is the base of the  output 
floor as defined in Basel Framework “Risk -based capital requirements ” (calculation of minimum risk -based capital requirements ) as specified  in the 
Output floor to be issued by SAMA.  
Scope of application : The template is mandatory for all banks using internal mo dels. 
Content:  RWA.  
Frequency:  Quarterly.  
Format:  Fixed.  
Accompanying narrative:  Banks are expected to explain the main drivers of difference (eg asset class or sub -asset class of a particular risk category, 
key assumptions underlying parameter estima tions, national implementation differences) between the internally modelled RWA disclosed that are used 
to calculate their capital ratios and RWA disclosed under the full standardised approach that would be used should the banks not be allowed to use 
internal models. Explanation should be specific and, where appropriate, might be supplemented with quantitative information. In pa rticular, if the 
RWA for securitisation exposures in the banking book are a main driver of the difference, banks are expected to ex plain the extent to which they are 
using each of the three potential approaches (SEC -ERBA, SEC -SA and 1,250% risk weight) for calculating SA RWA for securitisation exposures.

Definitions and instructions  
Rows:  
 
Credit risk (excluding counterparty credit risk, credit valuation adjustments and securitisation exposures in the banking boo k)  
(row 1):  
Definition of standardised approach:  The standardised approach for credit risk. When  calculating the degree of credit risk mitigation, banks must use the 
simple approach or the comprehensive approach with standard supervisory haircuts. This also includes failed trades and non -delivery -versus -payment 
transactions as set out in SCRE25 . 
The prohibition on the use of the IRB approach for equity exposures will be subject to a five -year linear phase -in arrangement as specified in SCRE17. 2. 
During the phase -in period, the risk weight for equity exposures used to calculate the RWA reported in colu mn (a) will be the greater of: (i) the risk weight 
as calculated under the IRB approach, and (ii) the risk weight set for the linear phase -in arrangement under the standardised approach for credit risk  
RWA for modelled approaches that banks have SAMA  appro val to use (cell 1/a): For exposures where the RWA is not computed based on the standardised 
approach described above (ie subject to the credit risk IRB approaches (Foundation Internal Ratings -Based (F -IRB), Advanced Internal Ratings -Based (A -
IRB) and supe rvisory slotting approaches of the credit risk framework). The row excludes all positions subject to SCRE18  to SCRE23 , including 
securitisation exposures in the banking book (which are reported in row 4) and capital requirements relating to a counterpart y credit risk charge, which are 
reported in row 2.  
RWA for portfolios where standardised approaches are used (cell 1/b): RWA which result from applying the above -described standardised approach.

Total actual RWA (cell 1/c): The sum of cells 1/a and 1/b.  
RWA calculated using full standardised approach (cell 1/d): RWA as would result from applying the above -described standardised approach to all exposures 
giving rise to the RWA reported in cell 1/c.  
Counterparty credit risk (row 2):  
Definition of standardised approach:  To calculate the exposure for derivatives, banks must use the standardised approach for measuring co unterparty credit 
risk (SA -CCR). The exposure amounts must then be multiplied by the relevant borrower risk weight using the standardised approach for c redit risk to calculate 
RWA under the standardised approach for credit risk.  
RWA for modelled approaches  that banks have SAMA  approval to use (cell 2/a): For exposures where the RWA is not computed based on the standardised 
approach described above.  
RWA for portfolios where standardised approaches are used (cell 2/b): RWA which result from applying the abov e-described standardised approach.  
Total actual RWA (cell 2/c): The sum of cells 2/a and 2/b.   
RWA calculated using full standardised approach (cell 2/d): RWA as would result from applying the above -described standardised approach to all exposures 
giving rise to the RWA reported in cell 2/c.  
Credit valuation adjustment (row 3):  
Definition of standardised approach:  The standardised approach for CVA (SA -CVA), the basic approach (BA -CVA) or 100% of a bank’s counterparty 
credit risk capital requirements (depe nding on which approach the bank uses for CVA risk).  
Total actual RWA (cell 3/c) and RWA calculated using full standardised approach (cell 3/d): RWA according to the standardised  approach described above.

RWA for modelled approaches that banks have SAMA  approval to use (cell 4/a): For exposures where the RW A is computed based on the SEC -IRBA or 
SEC-IAA.  
RWA for portfolios where standardised approaches are used (cell 4/b): RWA which result from applying the above -described standardised approach.  
Total actual RWA (cell 4/c): The sum of cells 4/a and 4/b.

Market risk (row 5):  
Definition of standardised approach:  The standardised approach for market risk. The SEC -ERBA, SEC -SA or a risk weight of 1,250% must also be used 
when determining the default risk charge component for securitisations held in the trading book.

Template CMS2 – Comparison of modelled and standardised RWA for credit risk at asset class 
level  
Purpose:  To compare risk -weighted assets (RWA) calculated according to the standardised approach (SA) for credit risk at the asset class level against 
the corresponding RWA figure calculated using the approaches (including both the standardised and IRB approach for credit ris k and the supervisory 
slotting approach) that banks have SAMA  approv al to use in accordance with the Basel framework for credit risk.  
Scope of application:  The template is mandatory for all banks using internal models for credit risk. Similar to row 1 of Template CMS1, it excludes  
counterparty credit risk, credit valuatio n adjustments and securitisation exposures in the banking book.  
Content:  RWA.  
Frequency:  Semiannual.  
Format:  Fixed. The columns are fixed, but the portfolio breakdowns in the rows will be set by SAMA  to reflect the exposure classes required under 
nation al implementation of IRB and SA.  Banks  are encouraged to add rows to show where significant differences occur.  
Accompanying narrative:  Banks are expected to explain the main drivers of differences between the internally modelled amounts disclosed that are  
used to calculate their capital ratios and amounts disclosed should the banks apply the standardised approach. Where differen ces are attributable to 
mapping between IRB and SA, banks are encouraged to provide explanation and estimated materiality.

1 The prohibition on the use of the I RB approach for equity exposures will be subject to a five -year linear phase -in 
arrangement as specified in SCRE 17.2. During the phase -in period, the risk weight for equity exposures (to be 
reported in column (a)) will be the greater of: (i) the risk weigh t as calculated under the IRB approach, and (ii) the 
risk weight set for the linear phase -in arrangement under the standardised approach for credit risk. Column (b) 
should reflect the corresponding RWA for these exposures based on the phased -in standardise d approach. After 
the phase -in period, columns (a) and (b) for equity exposures should both be empty.

14. Composition of capital and TLAC : 
14.1 The disclosures described in this chapter cove r the composition of regulatory capital, 
the main features of regulatory capital instruments and, for global systemically 
important banks, the composition of total loss -absorbing capacity and the creditor 
hierarchies of material subgroups and resolution en tities.  The disclosure 
requirements related to TLAC only, are not required to be completed by banks 
unless otherwise specified by SAMA.  
14.2 The disclosure requirements set out in this chapter are:  
14.2.1  Table CCA – Main features of regulatory capital instruments and  of other 
total loss -absorbing capacity (TLAC) - eligible instruments  
14.2.2  Template CC1 – Composition of regulatory capital  
14.2.3  Template CC2 – Reconciliation of regulatory capital to balance sheet  
14.2.4  Template TLAC1 – TLAC composition for global systemically important 
banks (G -SIBs) (at resolution group level)  
14.2.5  Template TLAC2 – Material subgroup entity – creditor ranking at legal 
entity level  
14.2.6  Template TLAC3 – Resolution entity – creditor ranking at legal entity level  
14.3 The following table and templates must be completed by  all banks:  
14.3.1  Table CCA details the main features of a bank ’s regulatory capital 
instruments and other TLAC -eligible instruments, where applicable. This 
table should be posted on a bank ’s website, with the web link referenced in 
the bank’s Pillar 3 report to  facilitate users ’ access to the required disclosure. 
Table CCA represents the minimum level of disclosure that banks are 
required to report in respect of each regulatory capital instrument and, where 
applicable, other TLAC -eligible instruments issued.2 
                                                           
2 In this context, “other TLAC -eligible instruments” are instruments other than regulatory capital instruments issued 
by G -SIBs that meet the TLAC eligibi lity criteria.

14.3.2  Template CC1 details the composition of a bank ’s regulatory capital.  
14.3.3  Template CC2 provides users of Pillar 3 data with a reconciliation between 
the scope of a bank ’s accounting consolidation, as per published financial 
statements, and the scope of its regula tory consolidation.  
14.4 The following additional templates must be completed by banks which have been 
designated as G -SIBs:  
14.4.1  Template TLAC1 provides details of the TLAC positions of G -SIB 
resolution groups. This disclosure requirement applies to all G -SIBs at t he 
resolution group level. For single point of entry G -SIBs, there is only one 
resolution group. This means that they only need to complete Template 
TLAC1 once to report their TLAC positions.  
14.4.2  Templates TLAC2 and TLAC3 present information on creditor rankin gs at 
the legal entity level for material subgroup entities (ie entities that are part 
of a material subgroup) which have issued internal TLAC to one or more 
resolution entities, and also for resolution entities. These templates provide 
information on the amount and residual maturity of TLAC and on the 
instruments issued by resolution entities and material subgroup entities that 
rank pari passu with, or junior to, TLAC instruments.  
14.5 Templates TLAC1, TLAC2 and TLAC3 become effective from the TLAC 
conformance date.  
14.6 Through the following three -step approach, all banks are required to show the link 
between the balance sheet in their published financial statements and the numbers 
disclosed in Template CC1:  
14.6.1  Step 1: Disclose the reported balance sheet under the regu latory scope of 
consolidation in Template CC2. If the scopes of regulatory consolidation 
and accounting consolidation are identical for a particular banking group, 
banks should state in Template CC2 that there is no difference and move on 
to Step 2. Where the accounting and regulatory scopes of consolidation 
differ, banks are required to disclose the list of those legal entities that are 
included within the accounting scope of consolidation, but excluded from 
the regulatory scope of consolidation or, altern atively, any legal entities 
included in the regulatory consolidation that are not included in the 
accounting scope of consolidation. This will enable users of Pillar 3 data to 
consider any risks posed by unconsolidated subsidiaries. If some entities are 
included in both the regulatory and accounting scopes of consolidation, but 
the method of consolidation differs between these two scopes, banks are 
required to list the relevant legal entities separately and explain the 

<<PAGE 27>>

Framework December  2022  2.1  
 
differences in the consolidation metho ds. For each legal entity that is 
required to be disclosed in this requirement, a bank must also disclose the 
total assets and equity on the entity ’s balance sheet and a description of the 
entity’s principal activities.  
14.6.2  Step 2: Expand the lines of the bala nce sheet under the regulatory scope of 
consolidation in Template CC2 to display all of the components that are used 
in Template CC1. It should be noted that banks will only need to expand 
elements of the balance sheet to the extent necessary to determine the 
components that are used in Template CC1 (eg if all of the paid -in capital of 
the bank meets the requirements to be included in Common Equity Tier 1 
(CET1) capital, the bank would not need to expand this line). The level of 
disclosure should be proport ionate to the complexity of the bank ’s balance 
sheet and its capital structure.  
14.6.3  Step 3: Map each of the components that are disclosed in Template CC2 in 
Step 2 to the composition of capital disclosure set out in Template CC1.

Table CCA - Main features of regulatory capital instruments and of other TLAC -eligible 
instruments  
Purpose:  Provide a description of the main features of a bank's regulatory capital instruments and other TLAC -eligible instruments, as applicable, that are 
recognised as pa rt of its capital base / TLAC resources.  
Scope of application:  The template is mandatory for all banks. In addition to completing the template for all regulatory capital instruments, G -SIB 
resolution entities should complete the template (including lines 3a and 34a) for all other TLAC -eligible instruments that are recognised as external TLAC 
resources by the resolution entities, starting from the TLAC conformance date. Internal TLAC instruments and other senior deb t instruments are not 
covered in this temp late. 
Content:  Quantitative and qualitative information as required.  
Frequency:  Table CCA should be posted on a bank's website. It should be updated whenever the bank issues or repays a capital instrument (or other 
TLAC -eligible instrument where applicab le), and whenever there is a redemption, conversion/writedown or other material change in the nature of an 
existing instrument. Updates should, at a minimum, be made semiannually. Banks should include the web link in each Pillar 3 r eport to the issuances m ade 
over the previous period.  
Format:  Flexible.  
Accompanying information:  Banks are required to make available on their websites the full terms and conditions of all instruments included in regulator y 
capital and TLAC.

Instructions  
Banks are required to complete the template for each outstanding regulatory capital instrument and, in the case of G -SIBs, TLAC -eligible instruments 
(banks should insert "NA" if the question is not applicable).  
Banks are required to report each instrument, including common shares, in a separate column of the template, such that the co mpleted Table CCA would 
provide a "main features report" that summarises all of the regulatory capital and TLAC -eligible instruments of the banking group. G -SIBs disclosing these 
instruments should group them under three sections (horizontally along the table) to indicate whether they are for meeting (i ) only capital (but not T LAC) 
requirements; (ii) both capital and TLAC requirements; or (iii) only TLAC (but not capital) requirements.

(i) Rows in italics will be deleted after all the ineligible capital instruments have been fully phased out (ie fr om 1 January 2022 onwards).  
(ii) The reconciliation requirements included in Template CC2 result in the decomposition of certain regulatory adjustments. For example, the 
disclosure template below includes the adjustment "Goodwill net of related tax liabili ty". The reconciliation requirements will lead to the 
disclosure of both the goodwill component and the related tax liability component of this regulatory adjustment.  
(iii) Shading:  
- Each dark grey row introduces a new section detailing a certain componen t of regulatory capital.  
- Light grey rows with no thick border represent the sum cells in the relevant section.  
- Light grey rows with a thick border show the main components of regulatory capital and the capital adequacy ratios.  
Columns  
Source: Banks are  required to complete column b to show the source of every major input, which is to be cross -referenced to the corresponding rows in 
Template CC2.  
Rows  
Set out in the following table is an explanation of each row of the template above. Regarding the regula tory adjustments, banks are required to report 
deductions from capital as positive numbers and additions to capital as negative numbers. For example, goodwill (row 8) shoul d be reported as a 
positive number, as should gains due to the change in the own cre dit risk of the bank (row 14). However, losses due to the change in the own credit risk 
of the bank should be reported as a negative number as these are added back in the calculation of CET1 capital.  
Row        
number  Explanation  
1 Instruments issued by t he parent company of t he reporting group that meet all of the CET1 capital entry criteria set out in  SACAP 2.2.1 . This 
shou ld be equal to the sum of common stock (and related surplus only) and other instruments for non -joint stock companies, both of which 
must meet the common stock criteria. This should be net of treasury stock and other investments in own shares to the extent th at these are 
already derecognised on the balance sheet under the relevant accounting standards. Other paid -in capital elements must  be excluded. All 
minority interest must be excluded.  
2 Retained earnings, prior to all regulatory adjustments. In accord ance with  SACAP2.2.1 , this row should include interim profit and loss that 
has met any audit, verification or review procedures that SAMA  has put in place. Dividends are to be removed in accordance with the 
applicable accounting standards, ie they should be removed from this row when they are removed from the balance sheet of the bank.  
3 Accumulated other comprehensive income and other disclosed reserves, prior to all regulatory adjustm ents. 
4 Directly issued capital instruments subject to phase -out from CET1 capital in accordance with the requirements of  SACAP5 .7. This is only 
applicable to non -joint stock companies. Banks structured a s joint stock companies must report zero in this row.  
5 Common share capital issued by subsidiaries and held by third parties. Only the amount that is eligible for inclusion in group CET1 capital 
should be reported here, as determined by the application o f SACAP 3.1 (see SACAP Annex # 7 for an example of the calculation).

the CET1 capital adequacy ratio of the bank (row 61) less the ratio of RWA of any common equity used to meet the bank's minimum CET1, 
Tier 1 and Total capital requirements. For example, suppose a bank has 100 RWA, 10 CET1 capital, 1.5 additional Tier 1 capita l and no Tier 
2 capital. Since it does not have any Tier 2 capital, it will hav e to earmark its CET1 capital to meet the 8% minimum capital requirement.

Instructions  
For SPE G -SIBs, where the resolution group is the same as the regulatory scope of consolidation for Basel III regulatory capital, those  rows that refer 
to regulatory capital before adjustments coincide with information provided under Template CC1. For MPE G -SIBs, information is provided for each 
resolution group. Aggregation of capital and total RWA for capital purposes across resolution groups will not necessarily equ al or directly correspond 
to values repor ted for regulatory capital and RWA under Template CC1.  
The TLAC position related to the regulatory capital of the resolution group shall include only capital instruments issued by entities belonging to the 
resolution group. Similarly, the TLAC position is based on the RWA (adjusted as permitted under Section 3 of the TLAC Term Sheet) and leverage 
ratio exposure measures calculated at the level of the resolution group.  Regarding the shading:  
- Each dark grey row introduces a new section detailing a certain c omponent of TLAC.  
- The light grey rows with no thick border represent the sum cells in the relevant section.  
- The light grey rows with a thick border show the main components of TLAC.  
The following table explains each row of the above template. Regarding  the regulatory adjustments, banks are required to report deductions from capital 
or TLAC as positive numbers and additions to capital or TLAC as negative numbers. For example, the amortised portion of Tier 2 where remaining 
maturity is greater than one ye ar (row 7) should be reported as a negative number (as it adds back in the calculation of Tier 2 instruments eligible as 
TLAC), while Tier 2 capital ineligible as TLAC (row 8) should be reported as a positive number.  
Row  
number  Explanation  
1 CET1 capital  of the resolution group, calculated in line with the Basel III and TLAC frameworks.  
2 AT 1 capital. This row will provide information on the AT1 capital of the resolution group, calculated in line with the  SACAP  standard and 
the TLAC framework.  
3 AT1 instruments issued out of subsidiaries to third parties that are ineligible as TLAC. According to Section 8c of the TLAC Term Sheet, 
such instruments could be recognised to meet minimum TLAC until 31 December 2021. An amount (equal to that reported in row 34 in 
Template CC1) should thus be reported only starting from 1 January 2022.  
4 Other elements of AT1 capital that are ineligible as TLAC (excluding those already incorpor ated in row 3).  
5 AT1 instruments eligible under the TLAC framework, to be calculated as row 2 minus rows 3 and 4.  
6 Tier 2 capital of the resolution group, calculated in line with the Basel III and TLAC frameworks.  
7 Amortised portion of Tier 2 instru ments where remaining maturity is greater than one year. This row recognises that as long as the remaining 
maturity of a Tier 2 instrument is above the one -year residual maturity requirement of the TLAC Term Sheet, the full amount may be 
included in TLAC, even if the instrument is partially derecognised in regulatory capital via the requirement to amortise the instrument in the 
five years before maturity. Only the amount not recognised in regulatory capital but meeting all TLAC eligibility criteria  should b e reported 
in this row.  
8 Tier 2 instruments issued out of subsidiaries to third parties that are ineligible as TLAC. According to Section 8c of the TL AC Term Sheet, 
such instruments could be recognised to meet minimum TLAC until 31 December 2021. An amou nt (equal to that reported in row 48 of 
Template CC1) should thus be reported only starting from 1 January 2022.  
9 Other elements of Tier 2 capital that are ineligible as TLAC (excluding those that are already incorporated in row 8).

11 TLAC arising from regulatory capital, to be calculated as: row 1 + row 5 + row 10.  
12 External TLAC instruments issued directly by the resolution entity and subo rdinated to excluded liabilities. The amount reported in this row 
must meet the subordination requirements set out in points (a) to (c) of Section 11 of the TLAC Term Sheet, or be exempt from  the 
requirement by meeting the conditions set out in points (i) to (iv) of the same section.  
13 External TLAC instruments issued directly by the resolution entity that are not subordinated to Excluded Liabilities but meet  the other TLAC 
Term Sheet requirements. The amount reported in this row should be those subject t o recognition as a result of the application of the 
penultimate and antepenultimate paragraphs of Section 11 of the TLAC Term Sheet. The full amounts should be reported in this row, ie 
without applying the 2.5% and 3.5% caps set out the penultimate paragra ph. 
14 The amount reported in row 13 above after the application of the 2.5% and 3.5% caps set out in the penultimate paragraph of S ection 11 of

15 External TLAC instrument issued by a funding vehicle prior to 1 January 2022. Amounts  issued after 1 January 2022 are not eligible as 
TLAC and should not be reported here.  
16 Eligible ex ante commitments to recapitalise a G -SIB in resolution, subject to the conditions set out in the second paragraph of Section 7 of 
the TLAC Term Sheet.  
17 Non-regulatory capital elements of TLAC before adjustments. To be calculated as: row 12 + row 14 + row 15 + row 16.  
18 TLAC before adjustments. To be calculated as: row 11 + row 17.  
19 Deductions of exposures between MPE G -SIB resolution groups that co rrespond to items eligible for TLAC (not applicable for SPE G -
SIBs). All amounts reported in this row should correspond to deductions applied after the appropriate adjustments agreed by t he crisis 
management group (CMG) (following the penultimate paragraph  of Section 3 of the TLAC Term Sheet, the CMG shall discuss and, where 
appropriate and consistent with the resolution strategy, agree on the allocation of the deduction).  
20 Deductions of investments in own other TLAC liabilities; amount to be deducted f rom TLAC resources in accordance with  SACAP4.1.6 . 
21 Other adjustments to TLAC.  
22 TLAC of the resolution group (as the case may be) after deductions. To be calculated as: row 18 - row 19 - row 20 - row 21.  
23 Total RWA of the resolution group under the  TLAC regime. For SPE G -SIBs, this information is based on the consolidated figure, so the 
amount reported in this row will coincide with that in row 60 of Template CC1.  
24 Leverage exposure measure of the resolution group (denominator of leverage ratio).  
25 TLAC ratio (as a percentage of RWA for TLAC purposes), to be calculated as row 22 divided by row 23.  
26 TLAC ratio (as a percentage of leverage exposure measure), to be calculated as row 22 divided by row 24.  
27 CET1 capital (as a percentage of RWA)  available after meeting the resolution group's minimum capital requirements and TLAC requirement. 
To be calculated as the CET1 capital adequacy ratio, less any common equity (as a percentage of RWA) used to meet CET1, Tier 1, and 
Total minimum capital and  TLAC requirements. For example, suppose a resolution group (that is subject to regulatory capital requirements) 
has 100 RWA, 10 CET1 capital, 1.5 AT1 capital, no Tier 2 capital and 9 non -regulatory capital TLAC -eligible instruments. The resolution 
group w ill have to earmark its CET1 capital to meet the 8% minimum capital requirement and 18% minimum TLAC requirement. The net 
CET1 capital left to meet other requirements (which could include Pillar 2 or buffers) will be 10 - 4.5 - 2 - 1 = 2.5.  
28 Bank -specif ic buffer requirement (capital conservation buffer plus countercyclical buffer requirements plus G -SIB buffer requirement, 
expressed as a percentage of RWA). Calculated as the sum of: (i) the G -SIB's capital conservation buffer; (ii) the G -SIB's specific 
countercyclical buffer requirement calculated in accordance with  SACAP ; and (iii) the higher loss -absorbency requirement as set out 
in SACAP . 
Not applicable to individual resolution groups of an MPE G -SIB, unless the relevant authority imposes buffer requirements at the level of 
consolidation and requires such disclosure.  
29 The amount in row 28 (expressed as a percentage of RWA) that relates to the capital conservation buffer), ie G -SIBs will report 2.5% here.  
Not applicable to individual resolution groups of an MPE  G-SIB, unless otherwise required by the relevant authority.  
30 The amount in row 28 (expressed as a percentage of RWA) that relates to the G -SIB's specific countercyclical buffer requirement.

  Purpose:  Provide creditors with information regarding their ranking in the liabilities structure of a material subgroup entity (ie an entity that is part of 
a material subgroup) which has issued internal TLAC to a G -SIB resolution entity.  
  Scope of application:  The template is mandatory for all G -SIBs. It is to be completed in respect of every material subgroup entity within eac h 
resolution group of a G -SIB, as defined by the FSB TLAC Term Sheet, on a legal entity basis. G -SIBs should group the templates according to the

This template is the same  as Template TLAC 2 except that no information is collected regarding exposures to the resolution entity (since the template 
describes the resolution entity itself). This means that there will only be one column for each layer of the creditor hierarc hy. 
 
Row 5 represents the subset of the amounts reported in row 4 that are TLAC -eligible according to the FSB TLAC Term Sheet (eg those that have a 
residual maturity of at least one year, are unsecured and if redeemable are not redeemable without SAMA  approval).  For the purposes of reporting this 
amount, the 2.5% cap (3.5% from 2022) on the exemption from the subordination requirement under the penultimate paragraph  of Section 11 of the 
TLAC Term Sheet should be disapplied. That is, amounts that are ineligible so lely as a result of the 2.5% cap (3.5%) should be included in full in row 5 
together with amounts that are receiving recognition as TLAC. See also the second paragraph in Section 7 of the FSB TLAC Term  Sheet.

Template CDC: Capital distribution constraints  
Purpose:  To provide disclosure of the capital ratio(s) below which capital distribution constraints are triggered as required under th e Basel framework 
(i.e. risk-based, leverage, etc.) to allow meaningful assessment by market participants of the likelihood of capital distributions becoming restricted.  
Scope of application  The table is mandatory for banks . Where applicable, the template may include additional rows to accommodate other national 
requirements that could trigger capital distribution constraints . 
Content:  Quantitative information. Includes the CET1 capital ratio that would trigger capital distribution constraints when taking int o account (i) 
CET1 capita l that banks must maintain to meet the minimum CET1 capital ratio, applicable risk  based buffer requirements ( i.e. capital conservation 
buffer, G -SIB surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer) and Pillar 2 capital requirements (if CET1 capital is requir ed); (ii) CET1 capital that banks 
must maintain to meet the minimum regulatory capital ratios and any CET1 capital used to meet Tier 1 c apital, total capital and TLAC3 requirements, 
applicable risk -based buffer requirements ( i.e. capital conservation buffe r, G-SIB surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer) and Pillar 2 capital 
requirements (if CET1 capital is required); and (iii) the leverage ratio inclusive of leverage ratio buffer requirement.  
Frequency:  Annual . 
Format:  Fixed.   
Accompanying narrativ e: In cases where capital distribution constraints have been imposed, banks should describe the constraints imposed. In 
addition, banks shall provide a link to the SAMA’s  website, where the characteristics governing capital distribution constraints are set  out (eg stacking 
hierarchy of buffers, relevant time frame between breach of buffer and application of constraints, definition of earnings and  distributable profits used 
to calculate restrictions ). Further, banks may choose to provide any additional infor mation they consider to be relevant for understanding the stated 
figures.

1 CET1 minimum plus Basel III buffers (not taking into account CET1 capital used to meet other min imum regulatory capital/TLAC ratios): 
CET1 capital ratio which would trigger capital distribution constraints, should the bank’s CET1 capital ratio fall below this  level. The ratio 
takes into account only CET1 capital that banks must maintain to meet the m inimum CET1 capital ratio (4.5%), applicable risk -based 
buffer requirements ( i.e. capital conservation buffer (2.5%), G -SIB surcharge and countercyclical capital buffer) and Pillar 2 capital 
requirements (if CET1 capital is required). The ratio does not ta ke into account instances where the bank has used its CET1 capital to meet 
its other minimum regulatory ratios ( i.e. Tier 1 capital, total capital and/or TLAC requirements), which could increase the CET1 capital 
ratio which the bank has to meet in order to  prevent capital distribution constraints from being triggered . 
2 CET1 minimum plus Basel III buffers (taking into account CET1 capital used to meet other minimum regulatory capital/TLAC rati os): 
CET1 capital ratio which would trigger capital distribution  constraints, should the bank’s CET1 capital ratio fall below this level. The ratio 
takes into account CET1 capital that banks must maintain to meet the minimum regulatory ratios (ie CET1, Tier 1, total capita l 
requirements and TLAC requirements), applicab le risk -based buffer requirements ( i.e. capital conservation buffer (2.5%), G -SIB surcharge 
and countercyclical capital buffer) and Pillar 2 capital requirements (if CET1 capital is required).

Rows  
 
The rows must strictly follow the balance sheet presentation used by the bank in its financial reporting.  
 
Columns  
 
If a bank's scope of accounting consolidation and its scope of regulatory consolidation are exactly the same, columns (a) a nd (b) should be merged.  
 
The breakdown of regulatory categories (c) to (f) corresponds to the breakdown prescribed in the rest of  SDIS , ie column (c) corresponds to the carrying 
values of items other than off -balance sheet items reported in  section 19  column (d) corresponds to the carrying values of items other than off -balance 
sheet items reported in  section 20 , column (e) corresponds to carrying values of items in the banking book other than off -balance sheet items reported in  
section 21  and column (f) c orresponds to the carrying values of items other than off -balance sheet items reported in  section 22.  
 
Column (g) includes amounts not subject to capital requirements according to the Basel framework or subject to deductions fro m regulatory capital.  
 
Note:  Where a single item attracts capital charges according to more than one risk category framework, it should be reported in all  columns 
that it attracts a capital charge. As a consequence, the sum of amounts in columns (c) to (g) may not equal the amounts i n column (b) as some 
items may be subject to regulatory capital charges in more than one risk category.  
 
For example, derivative assets/liabilities held in the regulatory trading book may relate to both column (d) and column (f). In such circumstances, the  
sum of the values in columns (c) -(g) would not equal to that in column (b). When amounts disclosed in two or more different columns are material and 
result in a difference between column (b) and the sum of columns (c) -(g), the reasons for this difference should be explained by banks in the accompanying 
narrative.

Template LI2: Main sources of differences between regulatory exposure amounts and carrying 
values in financial statements  
Purpose : Provide information on the main sources of differences (other t han due to different scopes of consolidation which are shown in Template 
LI1) between the financial statements' carrying value amounts and the exposure amounts used for regulatory purposes.  
Scope of application:  The template is mandatory for all banks.  
Content:  Carrying values that correspond to values reported in financial statements but according to the scope of regulatory consolida tion (rows 1 -3) 
and amounts considered for regulatory exposure purposes (row 10).  
Frequency : Annual.  
Format : Flexible. Ro w headings shown below are provided for illustrative purposes only and should be adapted by the bank to describe the most 
meaningful drivers for differences between its financial statement carrying values and the amounts considered for regulatory purposes.

  Instructions  
 
Amounts in rows 1 and 2, columns (b) -(e) correspond to the amounts in columns (c) -(f) of Template LI1.  
 
Row 1 of Template LI2 includes only asse ts that are risk -weighted under the Basel framework, while row 2 includes liabilities that are considered for 
the application of the risk weighting requirements, either as short positions, trading or derivative liabilities, or through the application of th e netting 
rules to calculate the net position of assets to be risk -weighted. These liabilities are not included in column (g) in Template LI1. Assets that are risk -
weighted under the Basel framework include assets that are not deducted from capital because  they are under the applicable thresholds or due to the 
netting with liabilities.  
 
Off-balance sheet amounts  include off -balance sheet original exposure in column (a) and the amounts subject to regulatory framework, after application 
of the credit conversi on factors (CCFs) where relevant in columns (b) -(d). 
 
Column (a) is not necessarily equal to the sum of columns (b) -(e) due to assets being risk -weighted more than once (see Template LI1). In addition, 
exposure values used for risk weighting may differ und er each risk framework depending on whether standardized  approaches or internal models are 
used in the computation of this exposure value. Therefore, for any type of risk framework, the exposure values under differen t regulatory approaches 
can be presented  separately in each of the columns if a separate presentation eases the reconciliation of the exposure values for banks.  
 
The breakdown of columns in regulatory risk categories (b) -(e) corresponds to the breakdown prescribed in the rest of the document, ie  column (b) 
credit risk corresponds to the exposures reported in  section  19, column (c) corresponds to the exposures reported in  section  21, column (d) corresponds 
to exposures reported in  section  20, and column (e) corresponds to the exposures reported in  section 22 . 
 
Differences due to consideration of provisions:  The exposure values under row 1 are the carrying amounts and hence net of provisi ons (ie specific and 
general provisions, as set out in  SACAP2.2.3 ). Nevertheless, exposures under the foundation internal ratings -based (F -IRB) and advanced internal 
ratings -based (A -IRB) approaches are risk -weighted gross of provisions. Row 7 therefore is  the re -inclusion of general and specific provisions in the 
carrying amount of exposures in the F -IRB and A -IRB approaches so that the carrying amount of those exposures is reconciled with their regulatory 
exposure value. Row 7 may also include the element s qualifying as general provisions that may have been deducted from the carrying amount of 

<<PAGE 51>>

exposures under the standardized  approach and that therefore need to be reintegrated in the regulatory exposure value of those exposures. Any 
differences between the  accounting impairment and the regulatory provisions under the Basel framework that have an impact on the exposure amounts 
considered for regulatory purposes should also be included in row 7.  
 
Exposure amounts considered for regulatory purposes:  The expres sion designates the aggregate amount considered as a starting point of the RWA 
calculation for each of the risk categories. Under the credit risk framework this should correspond either to the exposure am ount applied in the 
standardized  approach for credit  risk (see  SCRE 5) or to the exposures at default (EAD) in the IRB approach for credit risk (see  SCRE12.29 ); 
securitization  exposures should be defined as in the securitization  framework (see  SCRE18.4  and SCRE18.5) ; and counterpar ty credit exposures are 
defined as the EAD considered for counterparty credit risk purposes (see  SCCR5 ).

Template PV1: Prudent valuation adjustments (PVAs)  
  Purpose : Provide a breakdown of the constituent elements of a bank's PVAs according to the requirements of  Basel Framework “prudent valuation 
guidance ”, taking into account SAMA’s circular No. 301000000768 on  Supervisory guidance for assessing banks' financial instrument fair value 
practices , July 2009 .   
  Scope of application:  The template is mandatory for all banks which record PVAs.    
  Content:  PVAs for all assets measured at fair value (marked to market or marked to model) and for which PVAs are required. Assets can be non -
derivative or derivative instruments.    
  Frequency:  Annual.    
  Format:  Fixed. The row number cannot be altered. Rows which are not applicable to the reporting bank should be filled with "0" and th e reason why 
they are not applicable should be explained in the acc ompanying narrative.    
  Accompanying narrative:  Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant changes over the 
reporting period and the key drivers of such changes. In particular, banks are expected  to detail "Other adjustments", where significant, and to define 
them when they are not listed in the Basel framework. Banks are also expected to explain the types of financial instruments f or which the highest 
amounts of PVAs are observed.

3 Closeout cost:  PVAs required to  take account of the valuation uncertainty to adjust for the fact that the positio n level valuations calculated 
do not reflect an exit price for the position or portfolio (for example, where such valuations are calibrated to a mid -market price).    
4 Concentration:  PVAs over and above market price and closeout costs that would be requir ed to get to a prudent exit price for positions that 
are larger than the size of positions for which the valuation has been calculated ( i.e. cases where the aggregate position held by the bank is 
larger than normal traded volume or larger than the position  sizes on which observable quotes or trades that are used to calibrate the price 
or inputs used by the core valuation model are based).    
5 Early termination : PVAs to take into account the potential losses arising from contractual or non -contractual early  terminations of customer 
trades  that are not reflected in the valuation.    
6 Model risk : PVAs to take  into account valuation model risk which arises due to: (i) the potential existence of a range of different models or 
model calibrations which are used b y users of Pillar 3 data; (ii) the lack of a firm exit price for the specific product being valued; (iii) the 
use of an incorrect valuation methodology; (iv) the risk of using unobservable and possibly incorrect calibration parameters;  or (v) the fact 
that market or product factors are not captured by the core valuation model.    
7 Operational risk : PVAs to take into account the potential losses that may be incurred as a result of operational risk related to valuation 
processes.    
8 Investing and funding c osts: PVAs to reflect the valuation uncertainty in the funding costs that other users of Pillar 3 data would factor into 
the exit price for a position or portfolio. It includes funding valuation adjustments on derivatives exposures.    
9 Unearned credit sp reads : PVAs to take account of the valuation uncertainty in the adjustment necessary to include the current value of 
expected losses due to counterparty default on derivative positions, including the valuation uncertainty on CVA.    
10 Future administrativ e costs : PVAs to take into account the administrative costs and future hedging costs over the expected life of the 
exposures for which a direct exit price is not applied for the closeout costs. This valuation adjustment has to include the o perational costs  
arising from hedging, administration and settlement of contracts in the portfolio. The future administrative costs are incurr ed by the portfolio 
or position but are not reflected in the core valuation model or the prices used to calibrate inputs to that m odel.    
11 Other : "Other"  PVAs which are required to take into account factors that will influence the exit price but  which do not fall in any of the 
categories listed in  Basel Framework “prudent valuation guidance ” (Introduction) . These should be describ ed by banks in the narrative 
commentary that supports the disclosure.

17.1 The disclosure requirement under this section is: Template ENC – Asset 
encumbra nce. 
17.2 Template ENC provides information on the encumbered and unencumbered assets 
of a bank.  
17.3 The definition of “encumbered assets” in Template ENC is different to that under 
LCR30 for on -balance sheet assets. Specifically, the definition of “encumbered 
assets” in Template ENC excludes the aspect of asset monetization . Under Template 
ENC, “encumbered assets” are assets that the bank is restricted or prevented from 
liquidating, selling, transferring or assigning, due to regulatory, contractual or other 
limita tions.

Template ENC: Asset encumbrance  
Purpose:  To provide the amount of encumbered and unencumbered assets.  
Scope of application  The template is mandatory for all banks.  
Content:  Carrying amount for encumbered and unencumbered assets on the balance s heet using period -end values. Banks must use the specific 
definition of “encumbered assets” set out in the instructions below in making the disclosure. The scope of consolidation for the purposes of this 
disclosure requirement should be a bank’s regulatory  scope of consolidation, but including its securitization  exposures.  
Frequency:  Semiannual.  
Format:  Fixed.  Banks should always complete columns (a), ( b) and ( c).  
 
Banks  should group any assets used in central bank facilities with other encumbered and un encumbered assets, as appropriate.  
Accompanying narrative: Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain  
(i) any significant change in the amount of encumbered and unencumbered assets from the previous disclosure; (i i) as applicable, any definition of the 
amounts of encumbered and/or unencumbered assets broken down by types of transaction/category; and (iii) any other relevant i nformation necessary 
to understand the context of the disclosed figures.

Definitions  
The definitions are specific to this template and are not applicable for other parts of the Basel framework.  
Encumbered assets: Encumbered assets are assets that the bank is restricted or prevented from liquidating, selling, transferr ing or assigning due to 
legal, regulatory, contractual or other limitations. The definition of “encumbered ass ets” in Template ENC is different than that under the Liquidity 
Coverage Ratio for on -balance sheet assets. Specifically, the definition of “encumbered assets” in Template ENC excludes the aspect of asset 
monetization . For an unencumbered asset to qualify as high -quality liquid assets, the LCR requires a bank to have the ability to monetize  that asset 
during the stress period such that the bank can meet net cash outflows.  
Unencumbered assets: Unencumbered assets are assets which do not mee t the definition of encumbered.  
Instructions  
Total (in column ( c)): Sum of encumbered and unencumbered assets. The scope of consolidation for the purposes of this disclosure requirement sho uld

Definitions  
Gross carrying values:  on- and off -balance sheet items that give r ise to a credit risk exposure according to the Basel framework. On -balance 
sheet items include loans and debt securities. Off -balance sheet items must be measured according to the following criteria: (a) guarantees 
given - the maximum amount that the bank would have to pay if the guarantee were called. The amount must be gross of any credit conversion 
factor (CCF) or credit risk mitigation (CRM) techniques. (b) Irrevocable loan commitments - total amount that the bank has committed to lend. 
The amount must be gross of any CCF or CRM techniques. Revocable loan commitments must not be included. The gross value is the 
accounting value before any allowance/impairments but after considering write -offs. Banks must not take into account any credit risk mitigation 
technique.  
 
Write -offs for the purpose of this template are related to a direct reduction of the carrying amount when the entity has no reasonable 
expectations of recovery.  
 
Defaulted exposures : banks should use the definition of default that they also use for regulatory purposes. Banks must provide this definition 
of default in the accompanying narrative. For a bank using the standardized  approach for credit risk, the default exposures in Templates CR1 
and CR2 should correspond to exposures that are "past d ue for more than 90 days", as stated in  SCRE7.96 . 
 
Non-defaulted exposures : any exposure not meeting the above definition of default.  
 
Allowances/impairments : are those that are considered "credit -impaired" in the meaning of IFRS 9 Appendix A.  
 
Accounting provisions for credit losses : total amount of provisions, made via an allowance against impaired and not impair ed exposures 
according to the applicable accounting framework. For example, when the accounting framework is IFRS 9, "impaired exposures" are those 
that are considered "credit -impaired" in the meaning of IFRS 9 Appendix A. When the accounting framework is US GAAP, "impaired 
exposures" are those exposures for which credit losses are measured under ASC Topic 326 and for which the bank has recorded a  partial write -
off/write -down.  
 
Banks must fill in column d to f in accordance with the categorization  of accoun ting provisions distinguishing those meeting the conditions to 
be categorized  in general provisions, as defined in  SACAP2.2.3 , and those that are categorized  as specific provisions. This categorization  must 
be consistent with information provided in Table CRB.  
Net values:  Total gross value less allowances/impairments.  
 
Debt securities:  Debt securities exclude equity investments subject to the credit risk framework. However, banks may add a row between rows 
2 and 3 for "other investment" (if needed) and expl ain in the accompanying narrative.  
 
Linkages across templates  
Amount in [CR1:1/g] is equal to the sum [CR3:1/a] + [CR3:1/b].  
Amount in [CR1:2/g] is equal to the sum [CR3:2/a] + [CR3:2/b].  
Amount in [CR1:4/a] is equal to [CR2:6/a], only when (i) there is ze ro defaulted off -balance sheet exposure or SAMA  has exercised  its

Defaulted exposure:  such exposures must be r eported net of write -offs and gross of (ie ignoring) allowances/impairments. For a bank using the 
standardised approach for credit risk, the default exposures in Templates CR1 and CR2 should correspond to exposures that are  "past due for more 
than 90 days" , as stated in  SCRE7.96.  
 
Loans and debt securities that have defaulted since the last reporting period:  refers to any loan or debt securities that became marked as defaulted 
during the reporting period.  
 
Return to non -defaulted status:  refers to loans or debt securities that returned to non -default status during the reporting period.  
 
Amounts written off:  both total and partial write -offs. 
 
Other changes:  balancing items that are necessary to enable total to reconcile.  
 
 
  Purpose : Identify the changes in a bank's stock of def aulted exposures, the flows between non -defaulted and defaulted exposure categories 
and reductions in the stock of defaulted exposures due to write -offs. 
Scope of application:  The template is mandatory for all banks.  
Content:  Carrying values.  
Frequency : Semiannual.  
Format : Fixed.  
Accompanying  narrative : Banks should explain the drivers of any significant changes in the amounts of defaulted exposures from the 
previous reporting period and any significant movement between defaulted and non -defaulted loa ns. 
Banks should disclose in their accompanying narrative whether defaulted exposures include off -balance sheet items.

Qualitative disclosures  
(a) The scope and definitions of "past due" and "impaired" exposures used for accounting purposes and the dif ferences, if any, between the 
definition of past due and default for accounting and regulatory purposes. When the accounting framework is IFRS 9, "impaired  
exposures" are those that are considered "credit -impaired" in the meaning of IFRS 9 Appendix A.  
(b) The extent of past -due exposures (more than 90 days) that are not considered to be impaired and the reasons for this.  
(c) Description of methods used for determining accounting provisions for credit losses. In addition, banks that have adopted an ECL 
accounting model must provide information on the rationale for categorisation of ECL accounting provisions in general and speci fic 
categories for standardised approach exposures.  
(d) The bank's own definition of a restructured exposure. Banks should disclos e the definition of restructured exposures they use (which 
may be a definition from the local accounting or regulatory framework).  
Quantitative disclosures  
(e) Breakdown of exposures by geographical areas, industry and residual maturity.

Table CRB -A – Additional disclosure related to prudential treatment of problem assets  
Purpose:  To supplement the quantitative templates with additional information related to non -performin g exposures and forbearance.

Content:  Qualitative and quantitative information (carrying values corresponding to the accounting values reported in financial statem ents but 
according to the regulator y scope of consolidation)  
Frequency:  Annual.  
Format: Flexible.  
Banks must provide the following disclosures:  
 
Qualitative disclosures  
 
a) The bank’s own definition of non -performing exposures. The bank should specify in particular if it is using the defi nition provided in the 
guidelines on prudential treatment of problem assets (hereafter in this table referred to as SAMA’s Rules on Management of Problem No.  
41033343, January 2020. A nd provide a discussion on the implementation of its definition, includin g the materiality threshold used to categorise 
exposures as past due, the exit criteria of the non -performing category (providing information on a probation period, if relevant), together with 
any useful information for users’ understanding of this categor isation. This would include a discussion of any differences or unique processes 
for the categorisation of corporate and retail loans.  
b) The bank’s own definition of a forborne exposure. The bank should specify in particular if it is using the definition pro vided in the Guidelines 
and provide a discussion on the implementation of its definition, including the exit criteria of the restructured or forborne  category (providing 
information on the probation period, if relevant), together with any useful informatio n for users’ understanding of this categorisation. This would 
include a discussion of any differences or unique processes for the catagorisation of corporate and retail loans.4  
 
Quantitative disclosures  
 
c) Gross carrying value of total performing as well as non -performing exposures, broken down first by debt securities, loans and off -balance sheet 
exposures. Loans should be further broken down by corporate and retail exposures . Non-performing exposures should in addition be split into 
(i) defaulted exposur es and/or impaired exposures;5 (ii) exposures that are not defaulted/impaired exposures but are more than 90 days past due; 
and (iii) other exposures where there is evidence that full repayment is unlikely without the bank’s realisation of collatera l (whic h would include 
exposures that are not defaulted/impaired and are not more than 90 days past due but for which payment is unlikely without th e bank’s realisation 
of collateral, even if the exposures are not past due).  
Value adjustments and provisions6 or non-performing exposures should also be disclosed.  
d) Gross carrying values of restructured/forborne exposures broken down first by debt securities, loans and off -balance sheet exposures. Loans 
should be further broken down by corporate and retail exposures  to enable an understanding of material differences in the level of risk among 
different portfolios (eg retail exposures secured by real estate/mortages, revolving exposures, SMEs, other retail). Exposure s should, in addition, 
be split into performing and no n-performing, and impaired and not impaired exposures.  
Value adjustments and provisions for non -performing exposures should also be disclosed.  
 
                                                           
4   Banks are allowed to (i) merge row (d) of Table CRB with row (b) of Table CRB -A and (ii) merge row (h) 
of Table CRB with row (d) of Table CRB -A if and only if the bank uses a common definition for restructured 
and forbo rne exposures. The bank should clarify in the disclosure that they are applying a common definition 
for restructured and forborne exposures. In such case, the bank should also specify in the accompanying 
narrative that it uses a common definition for restr uctured exposures and forborne exposures that therefore, 
information disclosed regarding requirements of row (b) and row (d) of Table CRB -A have been merged with 
the row (d) and row (h) of Table CRB, respectively.  
5  When the accounting framework is IFRS 9 , “impaired exposures” are those that are considered “credit -
impaired” in the meaning of IFRS 9 Appendix A.  
6   Please refer to paragraph 33 of the Guidelines, where it is stated: “these value adjustments and provisions 
refer to both the allowance for cre dit losses and direct reductions of the outstanding of an exposure to reflect 
a decline in the counterparty’s creditworthiness”. For banks not applying the Guidelines, please refer to the 
definition of accounting provisions included in Template CR1, which is in line with paragraph 33 of the 
Guidelines.

netting.  
(b) Core features of policies and processes for collateral evaluation an d management.  
(c) Information about market or credit risk concentrations under the credit risk mitigation instruments used (ie by guarantor typ e, collateral 
and credit derivative providers).  
Banks should disclose a meaningful breakdown of their credit der ivative providers, and set the level of granularity of this breakdown in 
accordance with  section 10 . For instance, banks are not required to identify their derivative counterparties nominally if the name of the 
counterparty is considered to be confidential  information. Instead, the credit derivative exposure can be broken down by rating class or by 
type of counterparty (eg banks, other financial institutions, non -financial institutions).

Exposures unsecured - carrying amount:  carrying amount of exposures (net of allowances/impairments) that do not benefit from a credit risk 
mitigation technique.  
Exposures to be secured: carrying amount of exposures which have at lea st one credit risk mitigation mechanism (collateral, financial guarantees, 
credit derivatives) associated with them. The allocation of the carrying amount of multi -secured exposures to their different credit risk mitigation 
mechanisms is made by order of p riority, starting with the credit risk mitigation mechanism expected to be called first in the event of loss, and 
within the limits of the carrying amount of the secured exposures.  
Exposures secured by collateral: carrying amount of exposures (net of allow ances/impairments) partly or totally secured by collateral. In case an 
exposure is secured by collateral and other credit risk mitigation mechanism(s), the carrying amount of the exposures secured  by collateral is the 
remaining share of the exposure secure d by collateral after consideration of the shares of the exposure already secured by other mitigation 
mechanisms expected to be called beforehand in the event of a loss, without considering overcollateralisation.  
Exposures secured by financial guarantees: carrying amount of exposures (net of allowances/impairments) partly or totally secured by financial 
guarantees. In case an exposure is secured by financial guarantees and other credit risk mitigation mechanism, the carrying a mount of the exposure 
secured b y financial guarantees is the remaining share of the exposure secured by financial guarantees after consideration of the shar es of the 
exposure already secured by other mitigation mechanisms expected to be called beforehand in the event of a loss, without considering

Table CRD: Qualitative disclosure on banks' use of external credit ratings under the 
standardised approach for credit risk  
A. For portfolios that are risk -weighted under the standardised approach for credit risk, banks must disclose the following information:  
(a) Names of the external credit assessment institutions (ECAIs);  
(b) The asset classes for which each ECAI is used;  
(c) A description of the process  used to transfer the issuer to issue credit ratings onto comparable assets in the banking book 
(see SCRE8.16  to SCRE 8.18); and  
(d) The alignment of the alphanumerical scale of each agency used with risk buckets ( as per SAM A circular No. B.C.S 242, issued April 11, 2007 ). 
 
  Purpose : Supplement the information on a bank's use of the standardised approach with qua litative data on the use of external ratings.  
Scope of application:  The table is mandatory for all banks that: (a) use the credit risk standardised approach (or the simplified standardised 
approach); and (b) make use of external credit ratings for their RWA calculation.  
 
In order to provide meaningful information to users, the bank may choose not to disclose the information requested in the tab le if the exposures and 
RWA amounts are negligible. It is however required to explain why it considers the inform ation not to be meaningful to users, including a description 
of the portfolios concerned and the aggregate total RWA these portfolios represent.

Template CR4: Standardised approach – credit risk exposure and credit risk mitigation (CRM) 
effects  
Purpose:  To illustrate the effect of CRM (comprehensive and simple approach) on capital requirement ca lculations under the standardised approach 
for credit risk. RWA density provides a synthetic metric on the riskiness of each portfolio.  
Scope of application:  The template is mandatory for banks using the standardised approach for credit risk .  
Subject to SAMA approval of the immateriality of the asset class, banks that intend to adopt a phased rollout of the IRB approach may apply t he 
standardised approach to certain asset classes. In circumstances where exposures and RWA amounts subject to the standardise d approach may be 
considered to be negligible, and disclosure of this information to users would not provide any meaningful information, the ba nk may choose not to 
disclose the template for the exposures treated under the standardised approach. The bank mu st, however, explain why it considers the information not 
to be meaningful to users. The explanation must include a description of the exposures included in the respective portfolios and the aggregate total of 
RWA from such exposures.  
Content:  Regulatory  exposure amounts  
Frequency:  Semiannual . 
Format: Fixed. The columns  and rows  cannot be altered  unless SAMA make policy changes to the asset classes as defined under the finalised Basel

Template CR5: Standar dised approach - exposures by asset classes and risk weights  
Purpose:  To present the breakdown of credit risk exposures under the standardised approach by asset class and risk weight (correspondi ng to the riskiness attributed to the exposure according to 
standardised approach).  
Scope of application:  The template is mandatory for banks using the standardised approach.  
Subject to SAMA  approval of the immateriality of the asset class, banks that intend to adopt a phased rollout of the internal ratings -based ( IRB) approach may apply the standardised approach to 
certain asset classes. In circumstances where exposures and RWA amounts subject to the standardised approach may be considere d to be negligible, and disclosure of this information would not 
provide any m eaningful information to users, the bank may choose not to disclose the template for the exposures treated under the standard ised approach. The bank must, however, explain why it 
considers the information not to be meaningful to users. The explanation must  include a description of the exposures included in the respective portfolios and the aggregate to tal of RWA from such 
exposures.  
Content:  Regulatory exposure amounts . 
Frequency:  Semiannual.  
Format: Fixed. The columns and rows cannot be altered unless S AMA make policy changes to the asset classes as defined under the finalised Basel III framework.  
Accompanying narrative:  Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant change over the reportin g period and the key drivers of such 
changes. Banks should describe the sequence in which CCFs, provisioning and credit risk mitigation measures are applied.

7  The prohibition on the use of the IRB approach for equity exposures will be subject to a five -year linear phase -in arrangement from 1 January 
2022 (please see SCRE 17.1 and SCRE 17.2). During this phase -in period, the risk weight for equity exposures will be the greater of: (i) the risk 
weight as calculated under the IRB approach, and (ii) the risk weight set for the linear phase -in arrangement under the standardised approach for 
credit risk. Alternatively, SAMA  may require banks to apply the fully phased -in standardised approach treatment from the date of implementation 
of this standard. Accordingly, for disclosure purposes, banks that continue to apply the IRB approach during the phase -in period should repor t 
their equity exposures in either the 250% or the 400% column, according to whether the respective equity exposures are specul ative unlisted 
equities or all other equities.  
8  For disclosure purposes, banks that use the standardised approach for credit ri sk during the transitional period should report their equity exposures 
according to whether they would be classified as “other equity holdings” (250%) or “speculative unlisted equity” (400%). Risk  weights disclosed 
for “speculative unlisted equity exposure s” and “other equity holdings” should reflect the actual risk weights applied to these exposures in a 
particular year (please refer to the respective transitional arrangements set out in SCRE 17.1)

Template CRE: Qualitative disclosure related to IRB models  
Purpose:  Provide additional information on IRB models used to compute RWA.  
Scope of application:  he table is mandatory for banks using A -IRB or F -IRB approaches for some or all of their expo sures.  
To provide meaningful information to users, the bank must describe the main characteristics of the models used at the group -wide level (according to the scope of regulatory consolidation) and explain 
how the scope of models described was determined.  The commentary must include the percentage of RWA covered by the models for each of the bank's regulatory portfolios.  
Content:  Qualitative information.  
Frequency:  Annual.  
Format: Flexible.  
Banks must provide the following information on their use of I RB models:  
(a) Internal model development, controls and changes: role of the functions involved in the development, approval and subsequent changes of the credit risk models.  
(b) Relationships between risk management function and internal audit function and procedure to ensure the independence of the function in charge of the review of the models from the functions 
responsible for the development of the models.  
(c) Scope and main content of the reporting related to credit risk models.  
(d) Scope of the s upervisor's acceptance of approach.  
 
The "scope of the supervisor's acceptance of approach" refers to the scope of internal models approved by SAMA  in terms of entities within the group (if applicable), portfolios and exposure 
classes, with a breakdown bet ween foundation IRB (F -IRB) and advanced IRB (A -IRB), if applicable.  
(e) For each of the portfolios, the bank must indicate the part of EAD within the group (in percentage of total EAD) covered by s tandardised, F -IRB and A -IRB approach and the part of por tfolios 
that are involved in a roll -out plan.  
(f) The number of key models used with respect to each portfolio, with a brief discussion of the main differences among the model s within the same portfolios.  
(g) Description of the main characteristics of th e approved models:  
(i) definitions, methods and data for estimation and validation of PD (eg how PDs are estimated for low default portfolios; i f there are regulatory floors; the drivers for differences observed 
between PD and actual default rates at least  for the last three periods);  
 
and where applicable:  
 
(ii) LGD (eg methods to calculate downturn LGD; how LGDs are estimated for low default portfolio; the time lapse between the default event and the closure of the exposure);

Template CR9: IRB - Backtesting of probability of default (PD) per portfolio  
Purpose:  Provide backtesting data to validate the reliability of PD calculations. In particular, the template compares the PD used in IRB capital 
calculations with the effective default rates of bank obligors. A minimum five -year average annual default rate is required to compare the PD with a 
"more stable" default rate, although a bank may use a longer historical period that is consi stent with its actual risk management practices.  
Scope of application:  he template is mandatory for banks using the A -IRB and/or F -IRB approaches. Where a bank makes use of a F -IRB approach 
for certain exposures and an A -IRB approach for others, it must d isclose two separate sets of portfolio breakdown in separate templates.  
 
To provide meaningful information to users on the backtesting of their internal models through this template, the bank must i nclude in this template 
the key models used at the group -wide level (according to the scope of regulatory consolidation) and explain how the scope of models described was 
determined. The commentary must include the percentage of RWA covered by the models for which backtesting results are shown h ere for each of th e 
bank's regulatory portfolios.  
 
The models to be disclosed refer to any model, or combination of models, approved SAMA , for the generation of the PD used for calculating capital 
requirements under the IRB approach. This may include the model that is used to assign a risk rating to an obligor, and/or the model that calibrates the 
internal ratings to the PD scale.  
Content:  Modelling parameters used in IRB calculation.  
Frequency:  Annual.  
Format: Flexible.   
Accompanying narrative:  Banks are expected to sup plement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant changes over the 
reporting period and the key drivers of such changes. Banks may wish to supplement the template when disclosing the amount of  exposure and the 
number of obligors w hose defaulted exposures have been cured in the year.

credi t scores provided by a consumer credit bureau.  One column has to be filled in for each rating agency authorised for prudential purposes in the 
jurisdictions where the bank operates.  However, where such external ratings are not available, they need not be p rovided.  
 
Weighted average PD:  the same as reported in Template CR6. These are the estimated PDs assigned by the internal model authorised under the IRB 
approaches. The PD values are EAD -weighted and the "weight" is the EAD at the beginning of the period.  
 
Arithmetic average PD by obligors:  PD within range by number of obligor within the range. The average PD by obligors is the simple average: 
Arithmetic average PD = sum of PDs of all accounts (transactions) / number of accounts.  
 
Number of obligors:  two se ts of information are required: (i) the number of obligors at the end of the previous year; (ii) the number of obligors at th e 
end of the year subject to reporting;  
 
Defaulted obligors  in the year:  number of defaulted obligors during the year;  of which: ne w obligors defaulted in the year:  number of obligors having 
defaulted during the last 12 -month period that were not funded at the end of the previous financial year;  
 
Average historical annual default rate:  the five -year average of the annual default rate (obligors at the beginning of each year that are defaulted 
during that year/total obligor hold at the beginning of the year) is a minimum. The bank may use a longer historical period t hat is consistent with the 
bank's actual risk management practices. The disclosed average historical annual default rate disclosed should be before the application of the margin 
of conservatism.

Replacement Cost (RC):  For trades that are not subject to margining requirements, the RC is the loss that would occur if a coun terparty were to default 
and was closed out of its transactions immediately. For margined trades, it is the loss that would occur if a counterparty we re to default at present or at 
a future date, assuming that the closeout and replacement of transactions o ccur instantaneously. However, closeout of a trade upon a counterparty 
default may not be instantaneous. The replacement cost under the standardised approach for measuring counterparty credit risk  exposures is described 
in SCCR6 . 
 
Potential Future Exposure  is any potential increase in exposure between the present and up to the end of the margin period of risk. The potential futur e 
exposure for the stan dardised approach is described in  SCCR3 . 
 
Effective Expected Positive Exposure (EPE)  is the weighted average over time of the effective expected exposure over the first year, or, if all the 
contracts in the netting set mature before one year, over the time  period of the longest -maturity contract in the netting set where the weights are the 
proportion that an individual expected exposure represents of the entire time interval (see  SCCR 3). 
 
EAD post -CRM:  exposure at default. This refers to the amount relevant  for the capital requirements calculation having applied CRM techniques, credit 
valuation adjustments according to  SCCR5 .10 and specific wrong -way adjustments (see  SCCR7 ).

Template CCR3: Standardised approach - CCR exposures by regulatory  portfolio and risk 
weights  
Purpose : Provide a breakdown of counterparty credit risk exposures calculated according to the standardised approach: by portfolio ( type of 
counterparties) and by risk weight (riskiness attributed according to standardised appro ach).  
Scope of application:  The template is mandatory for all banks using the credit risk standardised approach to compute RWA for counterparty credit 
risk exposures, irrespective of the CCR approach used to determine exposure at default.  
 
If a bank deems  that the information requested in this template is not meaningful to users because the exposures and RWA amounts are negligib le, the 
bank may choose not to disclose the template. The bank is, however, required to explain in a narrative commentary why it c onsiders the information 
not to be meaningful to users, including a description of the exposures in the portfolios concerned and the aggregate total o f RWAs amount from such

Template CCR4: IRB - CCR exposures by portfolio and PD scale  
Purpose:  Provide all relevant parameters used for the calculation of counterparty  credit risk capital requirements for IRB models.  
Scope of application:  The template is mandatory for banks using an advanced IRB (A -IRB) or foundation IRB (F -IRB) approach to compute RWA for 
counterparty credit risk exposures, whatever CCR approach is us ed to determine exposure at default. Where a bank makes use of an FIRB approach for 
certain exposures and an AIRB approach for others, it must disclose two separate sets of portfolio breakdown in two separate templates.  
 
To provide meaningful information, the bank must include in this template the key models used at the group -wide level (according to the scope of 
regulatory consolidation) and explain how the scope of models described in this template was determined. The commentary must include the percentag e 
of RWAs covered by the models shown here for each of the bank's regulatory portfolios.  
Content:  RWA and parameters used in RWA calculations for exposures subject to the counterparty credit risk framework (excluding CVA ch arges or 
exposures cleared throu gh a CCP) and where the credit risk approach used to compute RWA is an IRB approach.  
Frequency : Semiannual.  
Format : Fixed . Columns and PD scales in the rows are fixed. However, the portfolio breakdown shown in the rows will be set by  SAMA to reflect the 
exposure categories required  under local implementations of IRB approaches.  
Accompanying narrative : Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant changes over the 
reporting period and the key drivers of such changes.

Collateral  used is def ined as referring to both legs of the transaction. Example: a bank transfers securities to a third party, and the third party  in turn 
posts collateral to the bank. The bank reports both legs of the transaction. The collateral received is reported in column  (e), while the collateral posted 
by the bank is reported in column (f). The fair value of collateral received or posted must be after any haircut. This means the value of collateral 
received will be reduced by the haircut (ie C(1 - Hs)) and collateral pos ted will be increased after the haircut (ie E(1 + Hs)).  
 
Segregated  refers to collateral which is held in a bankruptcy -remote manner according to the description included in  SCCR8.18 to SCCR8 .23. 
 
Unsegregated  refers to collateral that is not held in a ban kruptcy -remote manner.  
 
Domestic sovereign debt  refers to the sovereign debt of the jurisdiction of incorporation of the bank, or, when disclosures are made on a consolidate d 
basis, the jurisdiction of incorporation of the parent company.  
 
Domestic currenc y refers to items of collateral that are denominated in the bank's (consolidated) reporting currency and not the transaction cu rrency.

A qualifying central counterparty  (QCCP) is an entity that is licensed to operate as a CCP (including a licence granted by way of confirming an 
exemption), and is permitted by the appropriate reg ulator/overseer to operate as such with respect to the products offered . This is subject to the provision 
that the CCP is based and prudentially supervised in a jurisdiction where the relevant regulator/overseer has established , and publicly indicated, tha t it 
applies to the CCP on an ongoing basis, domestic rules and regulations that are consistent with the Committee on Payments and  Market Infrastructures 
and International Organization of Securities Commissions'  Principles for Financial Market Infrastructu res. See  SCCR 8 for the comprehensive definition 
and associated criteria.  
 
Initial margin  means a clearing member's or client's funded collateral posted to the CCP to mitigate the potential future credit exposure of  the CCP to 
the clearing member arising fr om the possible future change in the value of their transactions. For the purposes of this template, initial margin does not 
include contributions to a CCP for mutualised loss -sharing arrangements (ie in cases where a CCP uses initial margin to mutualise l osses among the 
clearing members, it will be treated as a default fund exposure).  
 
Prefunded default fund contributions  are prefunded clearing member contributions towards, or underwriting of, a CCP's mutualised loss -sharing 
arrangements.  
 
Unfunded default  fund contributions  are unfunded clearing member contributions towards, or underwriting of, a CCP's mutualised loss -sharing 
arrangements. If a bank is not a clearing member but a client of a clearing member, it should include its exposures to unfund ed defa ult fund contributions 
if applicable. Otherwise, banks should leave this row empty and explain the reason in the accompanying narrative.  
 
Segregated  refers to collateral which is held in a bankruptcy -remote manner according to the description included in  SCCR 8.18 to SCCR 8.23. 
 
Unsegregated refers to collateral that is not held in a bankruptcy -remote manner.

21. Securitisation : 
21.1 This chapter describes the disclosure requirements applying to securitisation 
exposures.  
21.2 The scope of  this section :11  
21.2.1  Covers all securitisation exposures12 in Table SECA and in templates SEC1 
and SEC2;  
21.2.2  Focuses on banking book securitisation ex posures subject to capital 
charges according to the securitisation framework in templates SEC3 and 
SEC4; and  
21.2.3  Excludes capital charges related to securitisation positions in the trading 
book that are reported in  section  22. 
21.3 Only securitisation exposures that the bank treats under the securitisation 
framework ( SCRE18  to SCRE 22) are disclosed in templates SEC3 and SEC4. For 
banks acting as  originators, this implies that the criteria for risk transfer 
recognition as described in  SCRE18.24  to SCRE18.29  are met. Conversely, all 
securitisation exposures, including those that do not meet the risk transfer 
recognition criteria, are reported in te mplates SEC1 and SEC2. As a result, 
templates SEC1 and SEC2 may include exposures that are subject to capital 
requirements according to both the credit risk and market risk frameworks and 
that are also included in other parts of the Pillar 3 report. The pu rpose is to provide 
a comprehensive view of banks' securitisation activities. There is no double -
counting of capital requirements as templates SEC3 and SEC4 are limited to 
exposures subject to the securitisation framework.  
21.4 The disclosure requirements under  this section  are:  
21.4.1  Table SECA – Qualitative disclosure requirements related to securitisation 
exposures  
                                                           
11  Unless stated otherwise, all terms used in section 21  are used consistently with the defi nitions in SCRE18 . 
12 Securitisation refers to the definition of what constitutes a securitisation under the Basel framework. 
Securitisation exposures correspond to securitisation exposures as defined in the Basel framework.  According 
to this framework, securitisation exposures can include, but are not restricted to, the following: asset -backed 
securities, mortgage -backed securities, credit enhancements, liquidity facilities, interest rate or currency 
swaps, credit derivative s and tranched cover as described in  SCRE 9. Reserve  accounts, such as cash collateral 
accounts, recorded as an asset by the originating bank must also be treated as securitisation exposures. 
Securitisation exposures refer to retained or purchased exposures  and not to underlying pools.

Table SECA: Qualitative disclosure requirements related to securitisation exposures  
  Purpose:  Provide qualitative information on a bank's strat egy and risk management with respect to its securitisation activities.  
  Scope of application:  The table is mandatory for all banks with securitisation exposures.  
  Content:  Qualitative information.  
  Frequency:  Annually.  
  Format:  Flexible.  
Qualitati ve disclosures  
(A) Banks must describe their risk management objectives and policies for securitisation activities and main features of thes e activities according to the 
framework below. If a bank holds securitisation positions reflected both in the regul atory banking book and in the regulatory trading book, the bank must 
describe each of the following points by distinguishing activities in each of the regulatory books.  
(a) The bank's objectives in relation to securitisation and re -securitisation activity , including the extent to which these activities transfer credit 
risk of the underlying securitised exposures away from the bank to other entities, the type of risks assumed and the types of  risks retained.  
(b) The bank must provide a list of:  
 special pur pose entities (SPEs) where the bank acts as sponsor (but not as an originator such as an Asset Backed Commercial Paper 
(ABCP) conduit), indicating whether the bank consolidates the SPEs into its scope of regulatory consolidation. A bank would 
generally be considered a "sponsor" if it, in fact or in substance, manages or advises the programme, places securities into the 
market, or provides liquidity and/or credit enhancements. The programme may include, for example, ABCP conduit programmes 
and structured inv estment vehicles.  
 affiliated entities (i) that the bank manages or advises and (ii) that invest either in the securitisation exposures that the  bank has 
securitised or in SPEs that the bank sponsors.  
 a list of entities to which the bank provides implicit s upport and the associated capital impact for each of them (as required in  
SCRE 18.14 and SCRE 18.49. 
(c) Summary of the bank's accounting policies for securitisation activities. Where relevant, banks are expected to distinguish se curitisation 
exposures from  re-securitisation exposures.  
(d) If applicable, the names of external credit assessment institution (ECAIs) used for securitisations and the types of securiti sation exposure 
for which each agency is used.  
(e) If applicable, describe the process for impl ementing the Basel internal assessment approach (IAA). The description should include:  
 structure of the internal assessment process and relation between internal assessment and external ratings, including informa tion on 
ECAIs as referenced in item (d) of t his table.  
 control mechanisms for the internal assessment process including discussion of independence, accountability, and internal 
assessment process review.  
 the exposure type to which the internal assessment process is applied; and stress factors used f or determining credit enhancement 
levels, by exposure type. For example, credit cards, home equity, auto, and securitisation exposures detailed by underlying e xposure 
type and security type (eg residential mortgage -backed securities, commercial mortgage -backed securities, asset -backed securities, 
collateralised debt obligations) etc.  
(f) Banks must describe the use of internal assessment other than for SEC -IAA capital purposes.

(i) When the " bank acts as originator " the securitisation exposures are the retained positions, even where not eligible for the securitisation framework due to th e absence of sign ificant and 
effective risk transfer (which may be presented separately).  
(ii) When " the bank acts as sponsor" , the securitisation exposures include exposures to commercial paper conduits to which the bank provides programme -wide enhancements, liquidity 
and other facilities. Where the bank acts both as originator and sponsor, it must avoid double -counting. In this regard, the bank can merge the two columns of "bank acts as originator" and 
"bank acts as sponsor" and use "bank acts as originator/sponsor" colum ns. 
(iii) Securitisation exposures when " the bank acts as an investor " are the investment positions purchased in third -party deals.  
Synthetic  transaction s: if the bank has purchased protection it must report the net exposure amounts to which it is exposed under columns originator/sponsor (ie the amount that is not 
secured). If the bank has sold protection, the exposure amount of the credit protection must be reported in the "investor" co lumn.  
Re-securitisation:  all securitisation exposures related to re -securitisation must be completed in rows "re -securitisation", and not in the preceding rows (by type of underlying asset) which 
contain only securitisation exposures other than re -securitisation.

Table MR1: Market risk under the standardised approach  
Purpose:  Provide the components of the capital requirements under the standardised approach for  market risk . 
Scope of application:  The template is mandatory for banks havin g part or all of their market risk capital requirements measured according to the 
standardised approach. For banks that use the internal models approach (IMA), the standardised approach capital requirement i n this template must be 
calculated based on the p ortfolios in trading desks that do not use the IMA (ie trading desks that are not deemed eligible to use the IMA per the term s 
of SMAR 10.4). 
Content:  Capital requirements (as defined in  SMAR 6 to SMAR 9). 
Frequency:  Semiannual.  
Format:  Fixed. Additional r ows can be added for the breakdown of other risks.  
Accompanying narrative:  Banks are expected to supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any significant change over the 
reporting period and the key drivers of such changes. In parti cular, the narrative should inform about changes in the scope of application, including 
changes due to trading desks for which capital requirements are calculated using the standardised approach.

22.2.2  Market risk under the internal models approach (IMA):  
 
Table MRB: Qualitative disclosures for banks using the IMA  
Purpose:  Provide the scope, main characteristics and key modelling choices of the different mod els used for the capital requirement computation of 
market risks using the IMA.  
Scope of application:  The table is mandatory for all banks using the IMA to calculate the market risk capital requirements. To provide meaningful 
information to users on a ban k’s use of internal models, the bank must describe the main characteristics of the models used at the group -wide level 
(according to the scope of regulatory consolidation) and explain the extent to which they represent all the models used at th e group -wide  level. The 
commentary must include the percentage of capital requirements covered by the models described for each of the regulatory mod els (expected shortfall 
(ES), default risk capital (DRC) requirement and stressed expected shortfall (SES) for non -mode llable risk factors (NMRFs)).  
Content:  Quantitative information.  
Frequency:  Annual.  
Format:  Flexible.  
(A) Banks must provide a general description of the trading desk structure (as defined in SMAR 4) and types of instruments included in the IMA trading 
desks. 
(B) For ES models, banks must provide the following information:  
(a) A description of trading desks  covered by the ES models. Where applicable, banks must also describe the main trading desks  not included in 
ES regulatory calculations (due to lack of histor ical data or model constraints) and treated under other measures (such as specific treatments 
allowed in some jurisdictions).  
(b) The soundness criteria on which the internal capital adequacy assessment is based (eg forward -looking stress testing) and a descr iption of the 
methodologies used to achieve a capital adequacy assessment that is consistent with the soundness standards.  
(c) A general description of the ES model(s). For example, banks may describe whether the model(s) is (are) based on historical s imulati on, Monte 
Carlo simulations or other appropriate analytical methods and the observation period for ES based on stressed observations (E SR,S). 
(d) The frequency by which model data is updated.  
(e) A description of the ES calculation based on current and stressed observations . For example, banks should describe the reduced set of risk 
factors used to calibrate the period of stress the share of the variations in the full ES that is explained by the reduced se t of risk factors, and the 
observation period  used to iden tify the most stressful 12 months.  
(C) SES 
(a) A general description of each methodology used to achieve a capital assessment for categories of NMRFs that is consistent wit h the required 
soundness standard.  
(D) Banks using internal models to determine the DRC must provide the following information:  
(a) A general description of the methodology: Information about the characteristics and scope of the value -at-risk (VaR) and whether different 
models are used for different exposure classes. For example, banks may describe t he range of probability of default (PD) by obligors on the 
different types of positions, the approaches used to correct market -implied PDs as applicable, the treatment of netting, basis risk between long 
and short exposures of different obligors, mismatch between a position and its hedge and concentrations that can arise within and across product 
classes during stressed conditions.  
(b) The methodology used to achieve a capital assessment that is consistent with both the required soundness standard and SMAR 13.18 to 
SMAR 13.39. 
(E) Validation of models and modelling processes  
(a) The approaches used in the validation of the models and modelling processes, describing general approaches used and the types  of assumptions 
and benchmarks on which they rely.

Template  OR1: Historical losses  
Purpose:  To disclose aggregate operational losses incurred over the past 10 years, based on the accounting date of the incurred losses. This disclosure 
informs the operational risk capital calculation. The general principle on retrospective disclosure set out in section 8.2  does not apply for this template. 
From the implementat ion date of the template onwards, disclosure of all prior periods is required, unless firms have been permitted by SAMA  to use 
fewer years in their capital calculation on a transitional basis.  
Scope of application:  The table is mandatory for: (i) all bank s that are in the second or third business indicator (BI) bucket, regardless of whether 
SAMA  has exer cised the national discretion to set the internal loss multiplier  (ILM) equal to one; and (ii) all banks in the first BI bucket which have 
received SAMA approval to include internal loss data to calculate their operational risk capital requirements.  
Content: Qualitative information.  
Frequency:  Annual.  
Format:  Fixed.  
Accompanying narrative : Banks are expected to supplement the template with narrative com mentary explaining the rationale in aggregate, for new 
loss exclusions since the previous disclosure. Banks should disclose any other material information, in aggregate, that would  help inform users as to 
its historical losses or its recoveries, with the e xception of confidential and proprietary information, including information about legal reserves.

25. Interest ra te risk in the banking book : 
25.1 The disclosure requirements set out in this chapter are:  
25.1.1  Table IRRBBA – Interest rate risk in the banking book (IRRBB) risk 
management objective and policies  
25.1.2  Template IRRBB1 – Quantitative information on IRRBB  
25.2 Table IRRBBA prov ides information on a bank ’s IRRBB risk management 
objective and policy. Template IRRBB1 provides quantitative IRRBB 
information, including the impact of interest rate shocks on their change in 
economic value of equity and net interest income, computed bas ed on a set of 
prescribed interest rate shock scenarios.  
25.3 Banks must disclose the measured changes in economic value of equity (∆EVE) 
and changes in net interest income (∆NII) under the prescribed interest rate shock 
scenarios set out in  Basel Framework “ Supervisory review process ” (Interest rate 
risk in the banking book) . In disclosing Table IRRBBA and Template IRRBB1, 
banks should use their own internal measurement system (IMS) to calculate the 
IRRBB exposure values  refer to SAMA circular No. 381000040243 date 
1438/04/12AH on Interest Rating Risk in The Banking Book (IRRBB) . Basel 
Framework “ Supervisory review process ” (Interest rate risk in the banking 
book)  provides  a standardised framework that banks may adopt as their IMS. In 
addition to quantitative di sclosure, banks should provide sufficient qualitative 
information and supporting detail to enable the market and wider public to:  
25.3.1  Monitor the sensitivity of the bank ’s economic value and earnings to 
changes in interest rates;  
25.3.2  Understand the primary assumpt ions underlying the measurement 
produced by the bank ’s IMS; and  
25.3.3  Have an insight into the bank ’s overall IRRBB objective and IRRBB 
management.  
25.4 For the disclosure of ∆EVE:

25.4.1  Banks should exclude their own equity from the computation of the 
exposure level;  
25.4.2  Banks should include all cash flows from all interest rate -sensitive assets, 
liabilities and off -balance sheet items in the banking book in the 
computation of their exposure. 13 Banks should disclose whether they 
have excluded or included commercial margins and other spread 
components in their cash flows;  
25.4.3  Cash flows should be discounted using either a risk -free rate or a risk -
free rate including comm ercial margins and other spread components 
(only if the bank has included commercial margins and other spread 
components in its cash flows). 14 Banks should disclose whether they 
have discounted their cash flows using a risk -free rate or a risk -free rate 
including commercial margins and other spread components; and  
25.4.4  ΔEVE should be computed with the assumption of a run -off balance 
sheet, where existing banking book positions amortise and are not 
replaced by any new business.  
25.5 In addition to the required disclos ures in Table IRRBBA and Template IRRBB1, 
banks are encouraged to make voluntary disclosures of information on internal 
measures of IRRBB that would assist the market in interpreting the mandatory 
disclosure numbers.  
  
                                                           
13 Interest rate -sensitive assets are assets which are not deducted from Common Equity Tier 1 capital and which 
exclude (i) fixed assets such as real estate or intangible assets as well as (ii) equity exposures in the banking 
book.  
14 The discounting factors must be representative of a risk -free zero coupon rate. An example of an acceptable 
yield curve is a secured interest rate swap curve.

purposes other than disclosure, eg for internal assessment of capital adequacy) are different from the modelling assumptions prescribed for the 
disclosure in Template IRRBB1, the bank should provide a description of those  assumptions and their directional implications and explain its 
rationale for making those assumptions (eg historical data, published research, management judgment and analysis).  
f A high -level description of how the bank hedges its IRRBB, as well as the associated accounting treatment.  
g A high -level description of key modelling and parametric assumptions used in calculating ∆EVE and ∆NII in Template IRRBB1, which inc ludes:

computation and discount rate used.  
 How the average repricing maturity of non -maturity deposits has been determined (including any unique product characteristics that 
affect assessment of repricing behaviour).  
 The methodology used to estimate the prepayment r ates of customer loans, and/or the early withdrawal rates for time deposits, and 
other significant assumptions.  
 Any other assumptions (including for instruments with behavioural optionalities that have been excluded) that have a material  
impact on the disc losed ∆EVE and ∆NII in Template IRRBB1, including an explanation of why these are material.  
 Any methods of aggregation across currencies and any significant interest rate correlations between different currencies.  
h (Optional) Any other information which the bank wishes to disclose regarding its interpretation of the significance and sensitivity of the

Template GSIB1 - Disclosure of G -SIB indicators  
Purpose:  Provide an overview of the indicators that feed into the Committee's methodology for assessing the systemic importance of glo bal banks.    
Scope of application:  The template is mandatory for banks which in the previous year have either been classified as G -SIBs, have a leverage ratio 
exposure measure exceeding EUR 200 billion or were included in the assessment sample by supervisory judgme nt (see Basel Framework “Scope and 
definitions” Global systemically important Banks ). 
For G -SIB assessment purposes, the applicable leverage ratio exposure measure definition is contained in the  SLEV . 
For application of this threshold, banks should use the applicable exchange rate information provided on the Basel Committee website 
at www.bis.org/bcbs/gsib/  . The disclosure its elf is made in the bank's own currency.    
Content:  At least the 12 indicators used in the assessment methodology of the G -SIB framework (see  Basel Framework “Scope and definitions” Global 
systemically important Banks ).   
Frequency:  Annual.    
Format:  Flexible.    
Accompanying narrative:  Banks should indicate the annual reference date of the information reported as well as the date of first public disclosure. 
Banks should include a web link to the disclosure of the previous G -SIB assessment exercise.  
Banks may supplement the template with a narrative commentary to explain any relevant qualitative characteristic deemed necessar y for understanding 
the quantitative data. This information may include explanations about the use of estimates with a short explan ation as regards the method used, mergers 
or modifications of the legal structure of the entity subjected to the reported data, the bucket to which the bank was alloca ted and changes in higher 
loss absorbency requirements, or reference to the Basel Committ ee website for data on denominators, cutoff scores and buckets.  
Regardless of whether Template GSIB1 is included in the annual Pillar 3 report, a bank's annual Pillar 3 report as well as al l the interim Pillar 3 reports 
should include a reference to the we bsite where current and previous disclosures of Template GSIB1 can be found.

Template CCyB1 - Geographical distribution of credit exposures used in the calculation of the 
bank -specific countercyclical capital buffer requirement  
Purpose:  Provide an overview of the geographical distribution of private sector credit exposures relevant for the calculation of the b ank's countercyclical 
capital buffer.  
Scope of application:  The temp late is mandatory for all banks subject to a countercyclical capital buffer requirement based on the jurisdictions  in which 
they have private sector credit exposures subject to a countercyclical capital buffer requirement compliant with the Basel st andards . Only banks with 
exposures to jurisdictions in which the countercyclical capital buffer rate is higher than zero should disclose this template . 
Content:  Private sector credit exposures and other relevant inputs necessary for the computation of the bank -specific countercyclical capital buffer rate.  
Frequency:  Semiannual.  
Format:  Flexible . Columns and rows might  be added or removed to fit with the domestic implementation of the countercyclical capital buffer and thereby 
provide information on any variable s necessary for its computation. A column or a row may be remov ed if the information is not relevant to the domestic 
implementation of the countercyclical capital buffer framework.  
Accompanying narrative:  For the purposes of the countercyclical capital bu ffer, banks should use, where possible, exposures on an "ultimate risk" basis. 
They should disclose the methodology of geographical allocation used, and explain the jurisdictions or types of exposures for  which the ultimate risk 
method is not used as a bas is for allocation. The allocation of exposures to jurisdictions should be made taking into consideration the clarifications p rovided 
by Basel Framework “Risk -based capital requirements” (Buffers above the regulatory minimum) . Information about the drivers for changes in the exposure 
amounts and the applicable jurisdiction -specific rates should be summarised.

Definitions and instructions  
Unless otherwise provided for in the domestic implementation of the countercyclical capital buffer framework, private sector credit exposures relevant for 
the ca lculation of the countercyclical capital buffer (relevant private sector credit exposures) refer to exposures to private sect or counterparties which attract 
a credit risk capital charge in the banking book, and the risk -weighted equivalent trading book cap ital charges for specific risk, the incremental risk charge 
and securitisation. Interbank exposures and exposures to the public sector are excluded, but non -bank financial sector exposures are included.  
Country : Country in which the bank has relevant priva te sector credit exposures, and which has set a countercyclical capital buffer rate greater than zero that 
was applicable during the reporting period covered by the template.  
Sum: Sum of private sector credit exposures or RWA for private sector credit expo sures, respectively, in jurisdictions with a non -zero countercyclical capital 
buffer rate.

Total : Total of private sector credit exposures or RWA for private  sector credit exposures, respectively, across all jurisdictions to which the bank is  exposed, 
including jurisdictions with no countercyclical capital buffer rate or with a countercycli cal capital buffer rate set at zero, and value of the bank -specific 
countercyclical capital buffer rate and resulting countercyclical capital buffer amount.  
Countercyclic al capital buffer rate : Countercyclical capital buffer rate set by SAMA  in question and in force during the period covered by the template or, 
where applicable, the higher countercyclical capital buffer rate set for the country in question by SAMA . Counter cyclical capital buffer rates that were set by 
SAMA , but are not yet applicable in the country in question at the disclosure reference date (pre -announced rates) must not be reported.  
Total exposure value:  If applicable, total private sector credit exposur es across all jurisdictions to which the bank is exposed, including jurisdictions with no 
countercyclical capital buffer rate or with a countercyclical capital buffer rate set at zero.  
Total RWA:  If applicable, total value of RWA for relevant private secto r credit exposures, across all jurisdictions  to which the bank is exposed, including 
jurisdictions with no countercyclical capital buffer rate or with a countercyclical capital buffer rate set at zero.  
Bank -specific countercyclical capital buffer rate : Cou ntercyclical capital buffer that varies between zero and 2.5% or, where appropriate, above 2.5% of total 
RWA calculated in accordance with  SACAP9.2 (B) and (C)  as a weighted average of the countercyclical capital buffer rates that are being applied in 
jurisdictions where the relevant credit exposures of the bank are located and reported in rows 1 to N. This figure (ie the bank -specific countercyclical capital 
buffer rate) may not be deduced from the figures reported in this template as private sector credit  exposures in jurisdictions that do not have a countercyclical 
capital buffer rate, which form part of the equation for calculating the figure, are not  required to be reported in this template.  
Countercyclical capital buffer amount : Amount of Common Equity  Tier 1 capital held to meet the countercyclical capital buffer requirement determined in 
accordance with  SACAP9.2 (B) and (C).

Template  LR1 - Summary comparison of accounting assets vs leverage ratio exposure measure  
Purpose:  To reconcile the total assets in the published financial statements with the leverag e ratio exposure measure.  
Scope of application:  The table is mandatory for all banks.  
Content: Quantitative information. The leverage ratio standard of the Basel framework ( SLEV) follows the same scope of regulatory consolidation as 
used for the risk -based capital requirements standard Basel Framework “Risk -based capital requirements” ). Disclosures should be reported on a quarter -
end basis. However, banks may, subject to approval from or due to requirements specified by SAMA , use more frequent calculation s (eg daily or 
monthly averaging). Banks are required to include the basis for their disclosures (eg quarter -end, daily averaging or monthly averaging, or a 
combination thereof).  
Frequency:  Quarterly.  
Format:  Fixed.  
Accompanying narrative:  Banks are re quired to disclose and detail the source of material differences between their total balance sheet assets, as 
reported in their financial statements, and their leverage ratio exposure measure.

1 The bank’s total consolidated asset s as per published financial statements.  
2 Where a banking, financial, insurance or commercial entity is outside the regulatory scope of consolidation, only the amount of the 
investment in the capital of that entity (ie only the carrying value of the inve stment, as opposed to the underlying assets and other exposures 
of the investee) shall be included in the leverage ratio exposure measure. However, investments in those entities that are de ducted from 
the bank's CET1 capital or from Additional Tier 1 capit al in accordance with SACAP4.3  to SACAP4.4  may also be deducted from the 
leverage ratio exposure measure. As these adjustments reduce the total leverage ratio exposure measure, they shall be reporte d as a negative 
amount.  
3 This row shows the reduction of  the leverage ratio exposure measure due to the exclusion of securitised exposures that meet the operational 
requirements for the recognition of risk transference according SCRE18 .24. As these adjustments reduce the total leverage ratio exposure 
measure, t hey shall be reported as a negative amount.

4 Adjustments related to the temporary exclusion of central bank reserves from the leverage ratio exposure measure, if enacted by SAMA 
to facilitate the implementation of monetary policies as per SLEV6.6. As the se adjustments reduce the total leverage ratio exposure 
measure, they shall be reported as a negative amount . 
5 This row shows the reduction of the consolidated assets for fiduciary assets that are recognised on the bank’s balance sheet pursuant to 
the op erative accounting framework and which meet the de -recognition criteria of IAS 39 / IFRS 9 or the IFRS 10 de -consolidation criteria. 
As these adjustments reduce the total leverage ratio exposure measure, they shall be reported as a negative amount.  
6 Adju stments for regular -way purchases and sales of financial assets subject to trade date accounting. The adjustment reflects (i) the reverse -
out of any offsetting between cash receivables for unsettled sales and cash payables for unsettled purchases of financ ial assets that may 
be recognised under the applicable accounting framework, and (ii) the offset between those cash receivables and cash payables  that are 
eligible per the criteria specified in SLEV7 .1.4 (i), (ii).  If this adjustment leads to an increase i n exposure, it shall be reported as a positive 
amount. If this adjustment leads to a decrease in exposure, it shall be reported as a negative amount.  
7 Adjustments for eligible cash -pooling transactions. The adjustment is the difference between the accoun ting value of cash -pooling 
transactions and the treatments specified in SLEV7 .1.5. If this adjustment leads to an increase in exposure, it shall be reported as a positive 
amount. If this adjustment leads to a decrease in exposure, it shall be reported as a  negative amount.  
8 Adjustments related to derivative financial instruments. The adjustment is the difference between the accounting value of the  derivatives 
recognised as assets and the leverage ratio exposure value as determined by application of SLEV7 .2.1 to SLEV7 .2.2 ((i) to (v)) and 
SLEV7 .2.3 to SLEV7 .2.15 . If this adjustment leads to an increase in exposure, institutions shall disclose this as a positive amount. If this 
adjustment leads to a decrease in exposure, institutions shall disclose this as a  negative amount.  
9 Adjustments related to Securities Financing Transactions (SFTs) (ie repurchase agreements and other similar secured lending).  The 
adjustment is the difference between the accounting value of the SFTs recognised as assets and the levera ge ratio exposure value as 
determined by application of SLEV7 .3.1, SLEV7 .3.3 and SLEV7 .3.4 to SLEV7 .3.5. If this adjustment leads to an increase in the exposure, 
institutions shall disclose this as a positive amount. If this adjustment leads to a decrease in exposure, institutions shall disclose this as a 
negative amount.  
10 The credit equivalent amount of off -balance sheet items determined by applying the relevant credit conversion factors to the nominal value 
of the off -balance sheet item, as specified i n SLEV7 .4.2. (iii), (iv), and SLEV7.4.3 (x)  As these amounts increase the total leverage ratio 
exposure measure, they shall be reported as a positive amount.  
11 Adjustments for prudent valuation adjustments and specific and general provisions that have r educed Tier 1 capital. This adjustment 
reduces the leverage ratio exposure measure by the amount of prudent valuation adjustments and by the amount of specific and general 
provisions that have reduced Tier 1 capital as determined by SLEV6 .2 and SLEV7 .1.2 and SLEV7 .4.2 (iv) , respectively. This adjustment 
shall be reported as a negative amount.  
12 Any other adjustments. If these adjustments lead to an increase in the exposure, institutions shall report this as a positive  amount. If these 
adjustments lead to a decrease in exposure, the institutions shall disclose this as a negative amount.  
13 The leverage ratio exposure, which should be the sum of the previous items.

Number  Explanation  
1 Banks must include all balance sheet assets in their exposure measure, including on  balance sheet derivatives collateral and collateral for 
SFTs, with the exception of on  balance sheet derivative and SFT assets that are included in rows 8 to 18. Derivatives and SFTs collateral 
refer to either collateral received or collateral provided (or any associated receivable asset) accounted as a balance sheet asset. Amounts 
are to be reported in accordance with SLEV7 .1.1 to SLEV7.1.4 and, where applicable, SLEV6 .4 and SLEV6 .6. 
2 Grossed -up amount of any collateral provided in relation to derivative exposures where the provision of that collateral has reduced t he 
value of the balance sheet assets under the bank's operative accou nting framework, in accordance with SLEV7 .2.3(ii) . 
3 Deductions of receivable assets in the amount of the cash variation margin provided in derivatives transactions where the pos ting of cash 
variation margin has resulted in the recognition of a receivable  asset under the bank's operative accounting framework. As the adjustments 
in this row reduce the exposure measure, they shall be reported as negative figures.  
4 Adjustment for securities received under a securities financing transaction where the bank ha s recognised the securities as an asset on its 
balance sheet. These amounts are to be excluded from the exposure measure in accordance with SLEV7 .3.3(i).  
 
As the adjustments in this row reduce the exposure measure, they shall be reported as negative figur es.

Template LIQ1: Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR)  
Purpose:  Present the breakdown of a bank's cash outflows and cash inflows, as well as its available high -quality liquid assets  (HQLA), as measured 
and defined according to the LCR standard.  
Scope of application:  The template is mandatory for all banks.  
Content:  Data must be presented as simple averages of daily observations over the previous quarter (ie the average calculated o ver a period of, typically, 
90 days) in the local currency.  
Frequency:  Quarterly.  
Format:  Fixed.  
Accompanying narrative:  Banks must publish the number of data points used in calculating the average figures in the template.  
In addition, a bank should pro vide sufficient qualitative discussion to facilitate users' understanding of its LCR calculation. For example, where 
significant to the LCR, banks could discuss:  
 the main drivers of their LCR results and the evolution of the contribution of inputs to the L CR's calculation over time;  
 intra-period changes as well as changes over time;  
 the composition of HQLA;  
 concentration of funding sources;  
 currency mismatch in the LCR; and  
 other inflows and outflows in the LCR calculation that are not captured in the LCR c ommon template but which the institution considers 
to be relevant for its liquidity profile.

General explanations  
Figures entered in the template must be averages of the observations of individual line items over the financial reporting period (ie the average of 
components and the average LCR over the most recent three months of daily positions, irrespective of the financial reporting schedule). The  averages 
are calculated after the application of any haircuts, inflow and outflow rates and caps,  where applicable. For example:  
 
where  T equals the number of observations in period  Qi. 
Weighted  figures of HQLA (row 1, third column) must be calculated af ter the application of the respective haircuts but before the application of any 
caps on Level 2B and Level 2 assets. Unweighted inflows and outflows (rows 2 -8, 11 -15 and 17 -20, second column) must be calculated as 
outstanding balances.  Weighted  inflows an d outflows (rows 2 -20, third column) must be calculated after the application of the inflow and outflow 
rates.  
Adjusted figures of HQLA (row 21, third column) must be calculated after the application of both (i) haircuts  and (ii) any applicable caps (ie ca p on 
Level 2B and Level 2 assets).  Adjusted  figures of net cash outflows (row 22, third column) must be calculated after the application of both (i) inflow 
and outflow rates  and (ii) any applicable cap (ie cap on inflows).  
The LCR (row 23) must be calculat ed as the average of observations of the LCR:  
                                                       
Not all reported figures will sum exactly, particularly in the denominator of the LCR. For example, "total net cash outflows"  (row 22) may not be 
exactly  equal to "total cash outflows" minus "total cash inflows" (row 16 minus row 20) if the cap on inflows is binding. Similarly, the disclosed LCR 
may not be equal to an LCR computed on the basis on the average values of the set of line items disclosed in the  template.  
Definitions and instructions:  
Columns  
Unweighted values  must be calculated as outstanding balances maturing or callable within 30 days (for inflows and outflows).  
Weighted values  must be calculated after the application of respective haircuts ( for HQLA) or inflow and outflow rates (for inflows and outflows).  
Adjusted values  must be calculated after the application of both (i) haircuts and inflow and outflow rates and (ii) any applicable caps (ie c ap on Level 
2B and Level 2 assets for HQLA and ca p on inflows).

Template LIQ2: Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR)  
Purpose:  Provide details of a bank's NSFR and selec ted details of its NSFR components.    
Scope of application:  The template is mandatory for all banks.    
Content:  Data must be presented as quarter -end observations in the local currency.    
Frequency:  Semiannual (but including two data sets covering the l atest and the previous quarter -ends).    
Format:  Fixed.    
Accompanying narrative:  Banks should provide a sufficient qualitative discussion on the NSFR to facilitate an understanding of the results and the 
accompanying data. For example, where significant,  banks could discuss:  
(a) drivers  of their NSFR results and the reasons for intra -period changes as well as the changes over time (eg changes in strategies, funding 
structure, circumstances); and  
(b) composition  of the bank's interdependent assets and liabilities (as defined in  SNSF8 ) and to what extent these transactions are interrelated.

General instructions for completion of the NSFR disclosure template  
Rows in the template are set and compulsory for all banks. Key points to note about the common template are:  
 Dark grey rows introduce a section of the NSFR template.  
 Light grey rows represent a broad subcomponent category of the NSFR in the relevant section.  
 Unshaded rows represent a subcomponent within the major categories under ASF and RSF items. As an exception, rows 21 and 23 are 
subcomponents of rows 20 and 22, respectively. Row 17 is the sum of rows 18, 19, 20, 22 and 24.  
 No data should be entered for the cross -hatched cells.  
 Figures entered in the template s hould be the quarter -end observations of individual line items.  
 Figures entered for each RSF line item should include both unencumbered and encumbered amounts.  
 Figures entered in unweighted columns are to be assigned on the basis of residual maturity and i n accordance with  SNSF5 . 
Items to be reported in the "no maturity" time bucket do not have a stated maturity. These may include, but are not limited t o, items such  as capital 
with perpetual maturity, non -maturity deposits, short positions, open maturity po sitions, non -HQLA equities and physical traded commodities.

29. Worked examples : 
Interpretation of the effective date - illustration  
29.1 The following table illustrates the application of paragraph  section 3.2 by 
specifying the first applicable fiscal period for disclosure requirements according 
to their frequency, using as example a bank with a fiscal year coinciding with the 
calendar year (case 1), a bank with a fiscal year ending in October of the same

Definitions  
Exposures unsecured - carrying amount:  carrying amount of exposures (net of allowances/impairments) that do  not benefit from a credit risk mitigation 
technique.  
Exposures to be secured : carrying amount of exposures which have at least one credit risk mitigation mechanism (collateral, financial guarantees, cr edit 
derivatives) associated with them. The allocation  of the carrying amount of multi -secured exposures to their different credit risk mitigation mechanisms 
is made by order of priority, starting with the credit risk mitigation mechanism expected to be called first in the event of loss, and within the limits  of the 
carrying amount of the secured exposures.  
Exposures secured by collateral:  carrying amount of exposures (net of allowances/impairments) partly or totally secured by collateral. In case an exposure 
is secured by collateral and other credit risk miti gation mechanism(s), the carrying amount of the exposures secured by collateral is the remaining share 
of the exposure secured by collateral after consideration of the shares of the exposure already secured by other mitigation m echanisms expected to be 
called beforehand in the event of a loss, without considering overcollateralisation.  
Exposures secured by financial guarantees : carrying amount of exposures (net of allowances/impairments) partly or totally secured by financial 
guarantees. In case an exposure  is secured by financial guarantees and other credit risk mitigation mechanism, the carrying amount of the exposure 
secured by financial guarantees is the remaining share of the exposure secured by financial guarantees after consideration of  the shares of the exposure 
already secured by other mitigation mechanisms expected to be called beforehand in the event of a loss, without considering o vercollateralisation.  
Exposures secured by credit derivatives:  carrying amount of exposures (net of allowances/impairm ents) partly or totally secured by credit derivatives. 
In case an exposure is secured by credit derivatives and other credit risk mitigation mechanism(s), the carrying amount of th e exposure secured by credit 
derivatives is the remaining share of the expos ure secured by credit derivatives after consideration of the shares of the exposure already secured by other 
mitigation mechanisms expected to be called beforehand in the event of a loss, without considering overcollateralisation.

30. Annexure 1 : Frequently asked questions (FAQ) : 
Article # Question  Answer  
Overview of risk management, key prudential metrics and RWA  
12 For counterparty credit risk 
(CCR) (rows 6 -9), the split 
requeste d is by the exposure 
at default (EAD) 
methodology classification 
used to determine exposure 
levels rather than the risk -
weighted asset (RWA) 
methodology classification 
used to determine risk 
weights. This contradicts 
the presentation for credit 
risk (rows 1–5) and 
securitisation (rows 16 -19). 
Should line items be added 
(where necessary) to 
reconcile the disclosure to 
the total RWA?  
 Template OV1 does not request CCR to be split by risk weighting 
methodology, but by EAD methodology. Nevertheless, banks 
shoul d add extra rows, as appropriate, to split the exposures by risk 
weighting methodology*, in order to facilitate the reconciliation 
with the RWA changes in Template CCR7.  
 
* RWA and capital requirements under the Standardised Approach 
for credit risk weight ing are to be subdivided in the standardised 
approach for counterparty credit risk (SA -CCR) and the internal 
models method (IMM), and the same for RWA and capital 
requirements under the internal ratings -based (IRB) approach for 
credit risk weighting.  
Comp osition of capital TLAC  
14 For the disclosure 
requirements un der section 
14 in the  event a bank 
restates its prior year 
accounting balance sheet, 
does the bank restate the 
archived prior year 
reconciliation templates?  
 The requirement to keep an archive o f a minimum period also 
applies to the reconciliation template. As such, any 
prospective/retrospective restatement of the balance sheet would 
require similar amendments to be reflected in the reconciliation 
templates within the archive with a clear indicat ion that such a 
revision has been made.  
Links between financial statements and regulatory exposures

deducted from regulatory 
capital in accordance with

goodwill and intangible assets and deferred tax assets) should be 
included in column (g), taking into consideration the different 
thresholds that apply where relevant. Assets should be disclo sed

intangible assets) disclosed 
in column (g)?  for the amount that is actually deducted from capital. Some 
examples are shown below:  
 - Goodwill and intangible assets: the amount to be disclosed in 
column (g) is the amount of any goodwill or intangibles,* 
including any goodwill included in the valu ation of significant 
investments in the capital of banking, financial and insurance 
entities that are outside the scope of regulatory consolidation. The 
amount disclosed in the assets rows is net of any associated 
deferred tax liability which would be exti nguished if the intangible 
assets become impaired or derecognised under the relevant 
accounting standards. The associated deferred tax liability is also 
to be disclosed in the liabilities rows of column (g).  
- Deferred tax assets: for all types of deferre d tax assets to be 
deducted from own funds, the amount to be disclosed in column 
(g) is net of associated deferred tax liabilities that are eligible for 
netting. The associated deferred tax liabilities are to be disclosed 
in the liabilities rows of column (g). For deferred tax assets, for 
which the deduction is subject to a threshold, the amount disclosed 
in column (g) in the assets rows is the amount, net of any eligible 
deferred tax liability, above the threshold. The associated deferred 
tax liabilities a re also to be disclosed in the liabilities rows of 
column (g).  
- Defined benefit pension fund assets: the amount disclosed is net 
of any deferred tax liabilities which would be extinguished if the 
asset should become impaired or derecognised under the rel evant 
accounting standards. These deferred tax liabilities are also to be 
disclosed in the liabilities rows of column (g).  
- Investments in own shares (treasury stock) or own instruments 
of regulatory capital: when investments in own shares or own 
instrum ents of regulatory capital are not already derecognised 
under the relevant accounting standards, the deducted amount 
disclosed is net of short positions in the same underlying exposure 
or in the same underlying index allowed to be netted under the 
Basel fr amework. These short positions are also to be disclosed in 
the liabilities rows of column (g).  
* Under SACAP4.1.1 , subject to SAMA  approval, IFRS definition 
of intangible assets to determine which assets are  classified as 
intangible and are thus required to be deducted.

 In Template LI1, are 
exposures required to be 
1,250% risk -weighted to be 
disclosed in column (g)?  1,250% risk -weighted exposures should be disclosed in the 
relevant credit risk or securitisation risk templates.  
 Template LI1: Considering  
that the risk weighting 
framework bears on assets 
rather than liabilities, should 
all the liabilities be 
disclosed in column (g)? 
Should in any case deferred 
tax liabilities and defined 
benefit pension fund 
liabilities be included in 
column (g)?  The liabi lities disclosed in column (g) are all liabilities under the 
regulatory scope of consolidation, except for the following, which 
are disclosed in columns (c), (d), (e) and (f) as applicable: 
liabilities that are included in the determination of the exposure  
values in the market risk or the counterparty credit risk framework; 
and liabilities that are eligible under the Basel netting rules.  
 What is the difference in 
Template LI2 between the 
required disclosure in row 2 
(Liabilities carrying value 
amount unde r regulatory 
scope of consolidation) and 
row 6 (Differences due to 
different netting rules, other 
than those already included 
in row 2).  Row 2 refers to balance sheet netting, while row 6 refers to 
incremental netting in application of the Basel rules (whe n not 
already covered by balance sheet netting). The netting rules under 
the Basel framework are different from the rules under the 
applicable accounting frameworks. The incremental netting in row 
6 could represent an additional deduction from the net expo sure 
value before application of the Basel netting rules (when those 
rules lead to more netting than the balance sheet netting in row 2) 
or a gross -up of the net exposure value when the off -balance sheet 
netting operated in row 2 is broader than what the B asel netting 
rules allow.  
 How does the disclosure in 
Template LI2, in particular 
row 3 (total net amount 
under regulatory scope of 
consolidated) relate to 
accounting equity?  The netting between assets and liabilities in Template LI2 does not 
lead to acco unting equity under a regulatory scope of 
consolidation being disclosed in row 3. Assets and liabilities 
included in rows 1 and 2 are limited to those assets and liabilities 
that are taken into consideration in the regulatory framework. 
Other assets and li abilities not considered in the regulatory 
framework are to be disclosed in column (g) in Template LI1 and 
are consequently excluded from rows 1 and 2 of Template LI2.  
 For Template LI2, how 
would the entry in row 10 
(exposure amounts In general, under a regulatory scope of consolidation, the 
accounting carrying amount and the regulatory exposure value 
would vary due to the incidence of off -balance sheet elements,

considered for regul atory 
purpose) differ from the 
balance sheet values under a 
regulatory scope of 
consolidation? Is it correct 
that there would be no 
differences to be explained, 
given that market risk does 
not have exposure values 
and the linkage for the other 
risk categor ies does not 
apply?  
 provisions, and different netting and measurement ru les. Under 
market risk, the regulatory exposure value will also differ from the 
accounting carrying amount. Differences could be due to off -
balance sheet items, netting rules and different measurement rules 
of market risk positions via prudent valuation (a s opposed to fair 
valuation in the applicable accounting framework).     
Credit risk  
19 How should the disclosure 
be made in Template CR3, 
in an example where a loan 
has multiple types of credit 
risk mitigation and is 
overcollateralised (eg a loan 
of 100 with land collateral 
of 120 as well as guarantees 
of 50)?  When an exposure benefits from multiple types of credit risk 
mitigation mechanisms, the exposure value should be allocated to 
each mechanism by order of priority based on the credit risk 
mitigation mechanism which banks would apply in the event of 
loss. Disclosure should be limited to the value of the exposure (ie 
the amount of overcollateralisation does not need to be disclosed 
in the table). If the bank wishes to disclose information regarding 
the over-collateralisation, it may do so in the accompanying 
narrative. Refer to example in section 28.3 . 
What are the values to be 
ascribed to collateral, 
guarantees and credit 
derivatives in Template 
CR3?  Banks should disclose the amount of credit risk mit igation 
calculated according to the regulatory framework, including both 
the costs to sell and of haircut.  
Where should exposures to 
central counterparties 
(CCPs) be included?  Exposures for trades, initial margins and default fund 
contributions are inclu ded in Template CCR8. Exposures 
stemming from loans to CCPs excluding initial margins and 
default fund contributions should be included within the credit risk 
framework considering the CCP as an asset class item. These loans 
should be included in the expos ure class where the national 

<<PAGE 161>>
   
 
 
 
 
Page Number 
161 of 168 Issue Date Version Number Pillar 3 Disclosure Requirements  
Framework December  2022  2.1  
 
implementation of the Basel framework allows exposures to CCPs 
to be included.  
In Template CR7, what is 
the required disclosure if an 
exposure is only partially 
hedged by a credit 
derivative? For instance, 
consider a loan wit h 
nominal exposure of 100  
SAR , risk weight of 150% 
and therefore RWA of 150  
SAR . The bank buys a credit 
default swap with a 30  SAR  
nominal amount, and the 
risk weight of the protection 
provider is 50%. Which 
values should be entered in 
columns (a) and (b)?  Under the IRB approach, credit derivatives are recognised as CRM 
techniques for the F -IRB and A -IRB. In both cases, banks can 
reflect the risk mitigating effect of credit derivatives on an 
exposure by adjusting their PD or loss -given -default (LGD). 
Banks should disclose in column (a), the RWA of an exposure 
secured by a credit derivative calculated without reflecting the risk 
mitigating effect of credit derivatives (in the example, banks 
would disclose 150  SAR ). In column (b), the RWA of the same 
exposure calculated reflecting the risk mitigating effect of credit 
derivatives (in the example, banks would disclose 30*50% + 
70*150% = 120) should be disclosed.  
Is the “weighted average 
PD” in column (d) of 
Template CR9 to be 
calculated based on the 
formula ∑(PD ί 
*EAD ί)/(∑EAD ί)? “Weighted” means exposure at default (EAD) -weighted. For this 
purpose, the formula in the question  is correct since the data will 
be comparable to those r eported in column (i).  
How should “defaulted 
obligors” be defined, for the 
purpose of Template CR9? 
For column (f) (number of 
obligors), please clarify how 
“obligors” are defined from 
a retail perspective. Should 
“end of the previous year” 
include only n on-defaulted 
accounts at the beginning of 
the year, or both defaulted 
and non -defaulted 
accounts? Should “end of The definition of obligors or retail obligors is the same as for other 
obligors; any individual person or persons, or a small or medium -
sized entity. Furthermore, where banks apply the “tra nsaction 
approach”, each transaction shall be considered as a single obligor. 
A defaulted obligor is an obligor that meets the conditions set out 
in SCRE16.67  to SCRE16.74 . 
For column (f), the “end of the previous year” includes non -
defaulted accounts at t he beginning of the year of reference for 
disclosure. The “end of the year” includes all the non -defaulted 
accounts related to obligors already included in the “end of the 
previous year” plus all the new obligors acquired during the year 
of reference for d isclosure which did not go into default during the

the year” include all active 
accounts at the end of the 
year? For column (g) 
(defaulted obligors in the 
year), please clarify whether 
it is rel ated to accounts that 
defaulted during the year or 
from inception.  year. Banks have discretion as to whether to include obligors who 
left during the year within the “end of the year” number.  
For column (g), “defaulted obligors” includes: (i) obligors not in 
default at th e beginning of the year who went into default during 
the year; and (ii) new obligors acquired during the year – through 
origination or purchase of loans, debt securities or off -balance 
sheet commitments – that were not in default, but which went into 
defaul t during the year. Obligors under (ii) are also separately 
disclosed in column (h). The PD or PD range to be included in 
columns (d) and (e) is the one assigned at the beginning of the 
period for obligors that are not in default at the beginning of the 
period. 
What considerations can 
institutions reference when 
disclosing a model 
performance test 
(backtesting) when the test 
is not aligned to the year -
end disclosure timetable?  The frequency of the disclosure is not linked to the timing of the 
bank’s backte sting. The annual disclosure frequency does not 
require a timetable of model backtesting that is calibrated on a 
calendar year basis. When the backtesting reference period is not 
calibrated on a calendar year basis, but on another time interval 
(for instan ce, a 12 - month interval), “year” as used in columns (f), 
(g) and (h) of Template CR9 means “over the period used for the 
backtesting of a model”. Banks must, however, disclose the time 
horizon (observation period /timetable) they use for their 
backtesting . 
Counterparty credit risk  
20 The “purpose” of Template 
CCR5 asks for a breakdown 
of all types of collateral 
posted or received. The 
content section, however, 
asks for collateral used. 
These numbers differ as 
certain transactions are 
over-collateralised (ie 
>100% of exposure) and 
therefore not all collateral 
would be used for risk 
mitigation. Should the 
template include all The numbers reported in Template CCR5 should be the total 
collateral p osted/received (ie not limited to the collateral that is 
applied/used for risk mitigation). The purpose of the template is to 
provide a view on the collateral posted/received rather than the 
value accounted for within the regulatory computation. If the ban k 
wishes to disclose the collateral eligible for credit mitigation, it 
may do so using an accompanying narrative.  

<<PAGE 163>>

collateral posted/received or 
just collateral that is 
applied?  
Template CCR7 refers to an 
RWA flow on internal 
models method (IMM) 
exposures. Row 4 (Model 
updates – IMM only) and 
row 5 (Methodology and 
policy – IMM only) are 
specifically to include only 
model and 
methodology/policy 
changes relating to the IMM 
exposures model. Where in 
the template would changes 
to the internal -ratings based 
(IRB) models that result in 
changes in risk weights for 
positions  under the IMM be 
reported?  
 Template CCR7 is consistent with Template OV1, which requests 
a split by exposure at default (EAD) methodology and not by risk 
weighting methodology. Banks are recommended to add rows to 
report any changes relating to risk weig hting methodology if they 
deem them useful. The row breakdown is flexible and intends to 
depict all the significant drivers of changes for the risk -weighted 
assets (RWA) under counterparty credit risk. Specific rows should 
be inserted when changes to the I RB model result in changes to 
the RWA of instruments under counterparty credit risk whose 
exposure value is determined based on the IMM.  
Securitisation  
21 Template SEC1 requires the 
disclosure of “carrying 
values”. Is there a direct link 
between columns (d), (h) 
and (l) of Template SEC1 
and column (e) of Template 
LI1?  Reconciliation is not possible when Template SEC1 presents 
securitisation exposures within and outside the securitisation 
framework together. However, when banks choose to disclose 
Template SEC1 and SEC2 separately for securitisation exposures 
within the securitisation framework and outside that framework, 
the following reconciliation is possible: the sum of on -balance 
sheet assets and liabilities included in columns (d), (h) and (l) of 
Templ ate SEC1 is equal to the amounts disclosed in column (e) of 
Template LI1.  
Should institutions disclose 
RWA before or after the 
application of the cap?  RWA figures disclosed in Templates SEC3 and SEC4 should be 
before application of the cap, as it is usef ul for users to compare 
exposures and risk -weighted assets (RWA) before application of 
the cap. Columns (a) –(m) in Templates SEC3 and SEC4 should be

should be reported after application of the  cap. RWA after 
application of the cap are disclosed in Template OV1.
